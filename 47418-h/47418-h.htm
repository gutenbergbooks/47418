<p>The idea of associating history with
some specific locality or institution,
has long ago occurred to the skilful
fabricators of romance. If old walls
could speak, what strange secrets
might they not reveal! The thought
suggests itself spontaneously even to
the mind of the boy; and though it
is incapable of realisation, writers&mdash;good,
bad, and indifferent&mdash;have
seriously applied themselves to the
task of extracting sermons from the
stones, and have feigned to reproduce
an audible voice from the vaults
of the dreary ruin. Such was at
least the primary idea of Scott, incomparably
the greatest master of
modern fiction, whilst preparing his
materials for the construction of the
<i>Heart of Mid-Lothian</i>. Victor Hugo
has made the Cathedral of Paris the
title and centre-point of his most
stirring and animated tale. Harrison
Ainsworth, who seems to think that
the world can never have too much of
a good thing, has assumed the office of
historiographer of antiquity, and has
treated us in succession to Chronicles
of Windsor Castle, the Tower, and
Old St Paul's. Those of the Bastile
have lately been written by an author
of no common power, whose modesty,
rarely imitated in these days, has left
us ignorant of his name; and we believe
that it would be possible to
augment the list to a considerable
extent. In all those works, however,
history was the subsidiary,
while romance was the principal ingredient;
we have now to deal with
a book which professes to abstain
from romance, though, in reality, no
romance whatever has yet been constructed
from materials of deeper
interest. We allude, of course, to
the work of Mr Francis; Mr Doubleday's
treatise is of a graver and a
sterner nature.</p>

<p>We dare say, that no inconsiderable
portion of those who derive their
literary nutriment from Maga, may
be at a loss to understand what element
of romance can lie in the history
of the Stock Exchange. With
all our boasted education, we are, in
so far as money-matters are concerned,
a singularly ignorant people.
That which ought to be the study of
every citizen, which <i>must</i> be the
study of every politician, and without
a competent knowledge of which the
exercise of the electoral franchise is a
blind vote given in the dark, is as
unintelligible as the Talmud to many
persons of more than ordinary accomplishment
and refinement. The
learned expounder of Thucydides
would be sorely puzzled, if called
upon to give an explanation of the
present funding system of Great
Britain. The man in easy circumstances,
who draws his dividend at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_656">656</span>
the Bank, knows little more about
the funds than that they mysteriously
yield him a certain return for capital
previously invested, and that the
interest he receives comes, in some
shape or other, from the general
pocket of the nation. He is aware
that consols oscillate, but he does
not very well understand why, though
he attributes their rise or fall to
foreign news. It never occurs to him
to inquire for what reason that which
yields a certain return, is yet liable
to such surprising and violent fluctuations;
he shakes his head in despair
at the mention of foreign exchanges,
and is not ashamed to avow his incapacity
to grapple with the recondite
question of the currency. And
yet it may not only be safely, but it
ought to be most broadly averred, that
without a due comprehension of the
monetary system of this country,
and the general commercial principles
which regulate the affairs of the
world, history is nothing more than a
tissue of barren facts and perpetual
contradictions, which it is profitless
to contemplate, and utterly impossible
to reconcile. Nay more, all
history which is written by authors,
who have failed to acknowledge the
tremendous potency of the monetary
power in directing the destinies of
nations, and who have neglected to
scrutinise closely the source and
operation of that power, must necessarily
be fallacious, and can only mislead
the reader, by false pictures of
the condition of the present as contrasted
with that of a former age.
No eloquence, no genius, will avail to
compensate for that radical defect,
with which some most popular writers
are justly chargeable, and a glaring
instance of which we propose to examine
in the course of the present
paper.</p>

<p>The study is said to be a dry one.
Certainly, until we have mastered
the details, it does look forbidding
enough; but, these once mastered,
our eyes appear to be touched with
fairy ointment. What formerly was
confusion, worse than Babel, assumes
a definite order. We behold, in
tangible form, a power so terribly
strong that with a touch it can
paralyse armies. We behold it gradually
weaving around us a net,
from which it is impossible to escape,
and claiming with a stern accent,
which brooks no denial, a right of
property in ourselves, our soil, our
earnings, our industry, and our children.
To its influence we can trace
most of the political changes which
perplex mankind, and which seem to
baffle explanation. Like the small
reptile of the old Northumbrian
legend, it has grown into a monstrous
dragon, capable of swallowing up
both herd and herdsman together.
The wisest of our statesmen have
tried to check its advance and failed;
the worst of them have encouraged its
growth, and almost declared it harmless;
the most adroit have yielded
to its power. Interest after interest
has gone down in the vain struggle
to oppose it, and yet its appetite still
remains as keen and insatiable as
ever.</p>

<p>When, in future years, the history
of this great nation and its dependencies
shall be adequately written, the
annalist must, perforce, give due prominence
to that power which we
weakly and foolishly overlook. He
will then see, that the matchless industry
displayed by Great Britain is
far less the spontaneous result of bold
and honest exertion, than the struggle
of a dire necessity which compels us
to go on, because it is death and ruin
to stand still. He will understand the
true source of all our marvellous machinery,
of that skill in arts which the
world never witnessed before, of our
powers of production pushed to the
utmost possible extent. And he will
understand more. He will be able to
comprehend why, within the circuit of
one island, the most colossal fortunes
and the most abject misery should
have existed together; why Britain,
admitted to be the richest of the
European states, and in one sense
imagined to be the strongest, should
at this moment exercise less influence
in the councils of the world than she
did in the days of Cromwell, and,
though well weaponed, be terrified to
strike a blow, lest the recoil should
prove fatal to herself. The knowledge
of such things is not too difficult for
our attainment; and attain it we must,
if, like sensible men, we are desirous
to ascertain the security or the precariousness
of our own position.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_657">657</span></p>

<p>The history of the Stock Exchange
involves, as a matter of necessity, the
history of our national debt. From
that debt the whole fabric arose; and,
interesting as are many of the details
connected with stock-jobbing, state-loans,
lotteries, and speculative manias,
the origin of the mystery appears to
us of far higher import. It involves
political considerations which ought
to be pondered at the present time,
because it has lately been averred, by
a writer of the very highest talent,
that the Revolution of 1688 was the
cause of unmingled good to this
country. That position we totally
deny. Whatever may be thought of
the folly of James II., in attempting
to force his own religion down the
throats of his subjects&mdash;however we
may brand him as a bigot, or denounce
him for an undue exercise of
the royal prerogative&mdash;he cannot be
taxed with financial oppression, or
general state extravagance. On the
contrary, it is a fact that the revenue
levied by the last of the reigning
Stuarts was exceedingly moderate in
amount, and exceedingly well applied
for the public service. It was
far less than that levied by the Long
Parliament, which has been estimated
at the sum of £4,862,700 a-year.
The revenue of James, in 1688,
amounted only to £2,001,855; and
at this charge he kept together a strong
and well-appointed fleet, and an army
of very nearly twenty thousand men.
The nation was neither ground by
taxes, nor impoverished by wars; and
whatever discontent might have been
excited by religious bickerings, and
even persecution, it is clear that the
great body of the people could not be
otherwise than happy, since they
were left in undisturbed possession of
their own earnings, and at full liberty
to enjoy the fruits of their own industry
and skill. As very brilliant pictures
have been drawn of the improved
state of England now, contrasted with
its former position under the administration
of James, we think it right to
exhibit another, which may, possibly,
surprise our readers. It is taken, from
Mr Doubleday's <i>Financial History of
England</i>, a work of absorbing interest
and uncommon research: we have
tested it minutely, by reference to
documents of the time, and we believe
it to be strictly true, as it is unquestionably
clear in its statements.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The state of the country," says Mr
Doubleday, "was, at the close of the reign
of James II., very prosperous. The whole
annual revenue required from his subjects,
by this king, amounted to only a couple
of millions of pounds sterling,&mdash;these
pounds being, in value, equal to about
thirty shillings of the money of the present
moment. So well off and easy, in
their circumstances, were the mass of the
people, that the poor-rates, which were
in those days liberally distributed, only
amounted to £300,000 yearly. The
population, being rich and well fed,
was moderate in numbers. No such
thing as 'surplus population' was even
dreamed of. Every man had constant
employment, at good wages; bankruptcy
was a thing scarcely known; and nothing
short of sheer and great misfortune, or
culpable and undeniable imprudence,
could drive men into the Gazette bankrupt-list,
or upon the parish-books. In
trade, profits were great and competition
small. Six per cent was commonly given
for money when it was really wanted.
Prudent men, after being twenty years in
business, generally retired with a comfortable
competence: and thus competition
was lessened, because men went out
of business almost as fast as others went
into it; and the eldest apprentice was
frequently the active successor of his retired
master, sometimes as the partner of
the son, and sometimes as the husband
of the daughter. In the intercourse of
ordinary life, a hospitality was kept up,
at which modern times choose to mock,
because they are too poverty-stricken to
imitate it. Servants had presents made
to them by guests, under the title of
'vails,' which often enabled them to
realise a comfortable sum for old age.
The dress of the times was as rich, and as
indicative of real wealth, as the modes of
living. Gold and silver lace was commonly
worn, and liveries were equally
costly. With less pretence of taste and
show, the dwellings were more substantially
built; and the furniture was solid
and serviceable, as well as ornamental&mdash;in
short all that it seemed to be."</p></blockquote>

<p>The above remarks apply principally
to the condition of the middle
classes. If they be true, as we see
no reason to doubt, it will at
once be evident that things have
altered for the worse, notwithstanding
the enormous spread of our manufactures,
the creation of our machinery,
and the constant and continuous labour
of more than a century and a half.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_658">658</span>
But there are other considerations
which we must not keep out of view,
if we wish to arrive at a thorough
understanding of this matter. Mr
Macaulay has devoted the most interesting
chapter of his history to an
investigation of the social state of
England under the Stuarts. Many of
his assertions have, as we observe,
been challenged; but there is one
which, so far as we are aware, has
not yet been touched. That is, his
picture of the condition of the
labouring man. We do not think it
necessary to combat his theory, as to
the delusion which he maintains to be
so common, when we contemplate the
times which have gone by, and compare
them with our own. There are
many kinds of delusion, and we suspect
that Mr Macaulay himself is by
no means free from the practice of using
coloured glasses to assist his natural
vision. But there are certain facts
which cannot, or ought not, to be perverted,
and from those facts we may
draw inferences which are almost next
to certainty. Mr Macaulay, in estimating
the condition of the labouring man
in the reign of King James, very properly
selects the rate of wages as a sound
criterion. Founding upon data which
are neither numerous nor distinct, he
arrives at the conclusion, that the
wages of the agricultural labourer of
that time, or rather of the time of
Charles II., were about half the
amount of the present ordinary rates.
At least so we understand him, though
he admits that, in some parts of the
kingdom, wages were as high as six,
or even seven shillings. <i>The value</i>,
however, of these shillings&mdash;that is,
the amount of commodities which
they could purchase&mdash;must, as Mr
Macaulay well knows, be taken into
consideration; and here we apprehend
that he is utterly wrong in his facts.
The following is his summary:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It seems clear, therefore, that the
wages of labour, estimated in money,
were, in 1685, not more than half of what
they now are; and there were few articles
important to the working man of which
the price was not, in 1685, more than half
of what it now is. Beer was undoubtedly
much cheaper in that age than at present.
Meat was also cheaper, but was still so
dear that hundreds of thousands of families
scarcely knew the taste of it. <i>In the cost
of wheat there has been very little change.</i>
The average price of the quarter, during
the last twelve years of Charles II.,
was <i>fifty shillings</i>. Bread, <i>therefore</i>,
such as is now given to the inmates of a
workhouse, was then seldom seen, even
on the trencher of a yeoman or of a shopkeeper.
The great majority of the nation
lived almost entirely on rye, barley, and
oats."</p></blockquote>

<p>If this be true, there must be a vast
mistake somewhere&mdash;a delusion which
most assuredly ought to be dispelled,
if any amount of examination can
serve that purpose. No fact, we believe,
has been so well ascertained,
or so frequently commented on, as the
almost total disappearance of the once
national estate of yeomen from the
face of the land. How this could
have happened, if Mr Macaulay is
right, we cannot understand; neither
can we account for the phenomenon
presented to us, by the exceedingly
small amount of the poor-rates levied
during the reign of King James. One
thing we know, for certain, that, in
his calculation of the price of wheat,
Mr Macaulay is decidedly wrong&mdash;wrong
in this way, that the average
which he quotes is the highest that he
could possibly select during two
reigns. Our authority is Adam Smith,
and it will be seen that his statement
differs most materially from that of
the accomplished historian.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1688, Mr Gregory King, a man
famous for his knowledge of matters of
this kind, estimated the average price of
wheat, in years of moderate plenty, to be
to the grower 3s. 6d. the bushel, or <i>eight-and-twenty
shillings the quarter</i>. The
grower's price I understand to be the
same with what is sometimes called the
contract price, or the price at which a farmer
contracts for a certain number of
years to deliver a certain quantity of corn
to a dealer. As a contract of this kind
saves the farmer the expense and trouble
of marketing, the contract price is generally
lower than what is supposed to be
the average market price. Mr King had
judged eight-and-twenty shillings the
quarter to be, at that time, the ordinary
contract price in years of moderate
plenty."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smith's</span> <i>Wealth of Nations</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In corroboration of this view, if so
eminent an authority as Adam Smith
requires any corroboration, we subjoin
the market prices of wheat at
Oxford for the four years of James's
reign. The averages are struck from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_659">659</span>
the highest and lowest prices calculated
at Lady-day and Michaelmas.</p>

<p>But the Oxford returns are always
higher than those of Mark Lane, which
latter again are above the average of
the whole country. So that, in forming
an estimate from such data, of the
general price over England, we may
be fairly entitled to deduct two shillings
a quarter, which will give a
result closely approximating to that
of Gregory King. We may add, that
this calculation was approved of and
repeated by Dr Davenant, who is
admitted even by Mr Macaulay to be
a competent authority.</p>

<p>Keeping the above facts in view,
let us attend to Mr Doubleday's
statement of the condition of the working
men, in those despotic days, when
national debts were unknown. It is
diametrically opposed in every respect
to that of Mr Macaulay: and, from
the character and research of the
writer, is well entitled to examination:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The condition of the working classes
was proportionably happy. Their wages
were good, and their means far above
want, where common prudence was joined
to ordinary strength. In the towns the
dwellings were cramped, by most of the
towns being walled; but in the country,
the labourers were mostly the owners of
their own cottages and gardens, which
studded the edges of the common lands
that were appended to every township.
The working classes, as well as the richer
people, kept all the church festivals,
saints' days, and holidays. Good Friday,
Easter and its week, Whitsuntide, Shrove
Tuesday, Ascension-day, Christmas, &amp;c.,
were all religiously observed. On every
festival, good fare abounded from the
palace to the cottage; and the poorest
wore strong broad-cloth and homespun
linen, compared with which the flimsy
fabrics of these times are mere worthless
gossamers and cobwebs, whether strength
or value be looked at. At this time, all
the rural population brewed their own
beer, which, except on fast-days, was the
ordinary beverage of the working man.
Flesh meat was commonly eaten by all
classes. The potato was little cultivated;
oatmeal was hardly used; even bread was
neglected where wheat was not ordinarily
grown, though wheaten bread (contrary
to what is sometimes asserted) was
generally consumed. In 1760, a later date,
when George III. began to reign, it was
computed that the whole people of England
(alone) amounted to six millions.
Of these, three millions seven hundred
and fifty thousand were believed to eat
wheaten bread; seven hundred and thirty-nine
thousand were computed to use barley
bread; eight hundred and eighty-eight
thousand, rye bread; and six hundred
and twenty-three thousand, oatmeal
and oat-cakes. All, however, ate bacon
or mutton, and drank beer and cider; tea
and coffee being then principally consumed
by the middle classes. The very
diseases attending this full mode of living
were an evidence of the state of national
comfort prevailing. Surfeit, apoplexy,
scrofula, gout, piles, and hepatitis; agues
of all sorts, from the want of drainage;
and malignant fevers in the walled towns,
from want of ventilation, were the ordinary
complaints. But consumption in
all its forms, marasmus and atrophy,
owing to the better living and clothing,
were comparatively unfrequent: and the
types of fever, which are caused by want,
equally so."</p></blockquote>

<p>We shall fairly confess that we
have been much confounded by the
dissimilarity of the two pictures; for
they probably furnish the strongest
instance on record of two historians
flatly contradicting each other. The
worst of the matter is, that we have
in reality few authentic data which
can enable us to decide between them.
So long as Gregory King speaks to
broad facts and prices, he is, we think,
accurate enough; but whenever he
gives way, as he does exceedingly
often, to his speculative and calculating
vein, we dare not trust him. For example,
he has entered into an elaborate
computation of the probable increase
of the people of England in succeeding
years, and, after a show of figures
which might excite envy in the breast
of the Editor of <i>The Economist</i>, he demonstrates
that the population in the
year 1900 cannot exceed 7,350,000
souls. With half a century to run, England
has already more than doubled
the prescribed number. Now, though
King certainly does attempt to frame
an estimate of the number of those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_660">660</span>
who, in his time, did not indulge in
butcher meat more than once a week,
we cannot trust an assertion which
was, in point of fact, neither more nor
less than a wide guess; but we may,
with perfect safety, accept his prices
of provisions, which show that high
living was clearly within the reach of
the very poorest. Beef sold then at
1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>d., and mutton at 2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>d. per lb.; so
that the taste of those viands must
have been tolerably well known to
the hundreds of thousands of families
whom Mr Macaulay has condemned
to the coarsest farinaceous diet.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that we have no
clear evidence as to the poor-rates,
which can aid us in elucidating this
matter. Mr Macaulay, speaking of
that impost, says, "It was computed,
in the reign of Charles II., at near
seven hundred thousand pounds a-year,
much more than the produce
either of the excise or the customs,
and little less than half the entire
revenue of the crown. <i>The poor-rate
went on increasing rapidly</i>, and appears
to have risen in a short time to
between eight and nine hundred thousand
a-year&mdash;that is to say, to one-sixth
of what it now is. The population
was then less than one-third of
what it now is." This view may be
correct, but it is certainly not borne
out by Mr Porter, who says that,
"so recently as the reign of George
II., the amount raised within the year
for poor-rates and county-rates in England
and Wales, was only £730,000.
This was the average amount collected
in the years 1748, 1749, 1750."
To establish anything like a rapid
increase, we must assume a much
lower figure than that from which Mr
Macaulay starts. A rise of £30,000
in some sixty years is no remarkable
addition. Mr Doubleday, as we have
seen, estimates the amount of the
rate at only £300,000.</p>

<p>But even granting that the poor-rate
was considered high in the days
of James, it bore no proportion to the
existing population such as that of the
present impost. The population of
England has trebled since then, and
we have seen the poor-rates rise to
the enormous sum of seven millions.
Surely that is no token of the superior
comfort of our people. We shall not
do more than allude to another topic,
which, however, might well bear amplification.
It is beyond all doubt,
that, before the Revolution, the agricultural
labourer was the free master
of his house and garden, and had,
moreover, rights of pasturage and
commonty, all which have long ago
disappeared. The lesser freeholds, also,
have been in a great measure absorbed.

<p>we doubt not that he intended to
refer to the virtual extirpation of a
race, which has long ago been compelled
to part with its birthright, in
order to satisfy the demands of inexorable
Mammon. Even whilst we are
writing, a strong and unexpected corroboration
of the correctness of our
views has appeared in the public prints.
Towards the commencement of the
present month, November, a deputation
from the agricultural labourers of
Wiltshire waited upon the Hon. Sidney
Herbert, to represent the misery
of their present condition. Their
wages, they said, were from six to
seven shillings a-week, and they
asked, with much reason, how, upon
such a pittance, they could be expected
to maintain their families. This is
precisely the same amount of nominal
wage which Mr Macaulay assigns to
the labourer of the time of King James.
But, in order to equalise the values,
we must add a third more to the latter,
which is at once decisive of the
question. Perhaps Mr Macaulay, in a
future edition, will condescend to explain
how it is possible that the labourer
of our times can be in a better
condition than his ancestor, seeing
that the price of wheat is nearly
doubled, and that of butcher-meat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_661">661</span>
fully quadrupled? We are content to
take his own authorities, King and
Davenant, as to prices; and the results
are now before the reader.</p>

<p>These remarks we have felt ourselves
compelled to make, because it
is necessary that, before touching upon
the institution of the national debt,
we should clearly understand what was
the true condition of the people. We
believe it possible to condense the
leading features within the compass of
a single sentence. There were few
colossal fortunes, because there was
no stock gambling; there was little
poverty, because taxation was extremely
light, the means of labour
within the reach of all, prices moderate,
and provisions plentiful: there
was less luxury, but more comfort,
and that comfort was far more equally
distributed than now. It is quite true,
that if a man breaks his arm at
the present day, he can have it better
set; but rags and an empty belly are
worse evils than indifferent surgical
treatment.</p>

<p>We are very far from wishing to
attribute this state of national comfort&mdash;for
we think that is the fittest
word&mdash;to the personal exertions of
James. We give him no credit for
it whatever. His bigotry was far
greater than his prudence; and he forfeited
his throne, and lost the allegiance
of the gentlemen of England,
in consequence of his insane attempt
to thrust Popery upon the nation.
But if we regard him simply as a
financial monarch, we must admit
that he taxed his subjects lightly,
used the taxes which he drew judiciously
for the public service and establishment,
and imposed no burden
upon posterity.</p>

<p>The peculiar, and, to them, fatal
policy of the Stuart family was this,
that they sought to reign as much as
possible independent of the control of
parliaments. Had they not been
blinded by old traditions, they must
have seen that, in attempting to do
so, they were grasping at the shadow
without the possibility of attaining the
substance. They came to the English
throne too late to command the public
purse, and at a period of time when
voluntary subsidies were visionary.
They looked upon parliaments with an
eye of extreme jealousy; and parliaments,
in return, were exceedingly
chary of voting them the necessary
supplies. Corruption, as it afterwards
crept into the senate, was never used
by the Stuarts as a direct engine of
power. The sales of dignities by the
first James, detrimental as they proved
to the dignity of the crown, were in
substitution of direct taxation from
the people. When supplies were withheld,
or only granted with a niggardly
hand, it was but natural in the monarch
to attempt to recruit his exchequer
by means of extraordinary and
often most questionable expedients.
The second James, had he chosen to
bribe the Commons, might have been
utterly too strong for any combination
of the nobles. William III. was
troubled with no scruples on the score
of prerogative. He saw clearly the
intimate and indissoluble connexion
between power and money: he secured
both by acquiescing in a violent change
of the constitution as it had hitherto
existed; held them during his life, and
used them for the furtherance of his
own designs; and left us as his legacy,
the nucleus of a debt constructed on
such a scheme that its influence must
be felt to the remotest range of posterity.</p>

<p>That the exigencies of every state
must be met by loans, is a proposition
which it would be useless to
question. Such loans are, however,
strictly speaking, merely an anticipation
of taxes to be raised from the
country and generation which reaps
the benefit of the expenditure. Such
was the old principle, founded upon
law, equity, and reason; and it signifies
nothing how many instances of
forced loans, and breach of repayment,
may be called from our earlier
history. Mr Macaulay says, "From
a period of immemorial antiquity, it
had been the practice of every English
government to contract debts.
What the Revolution introduced was
the practise of honestly paying them."
This is epigrammatic, but not sound.
From the time when the Commons
had the power of granting or withholding
supplies, <i>they</i> became the
arbiters of what was and what was
not properly a state obligation. In
order to ascertain the actual value of
a debt, and the measure of the creditor's
claim, we must necessarily look
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_662">662</span>
to the nature of the security granted
at the time of borrowing. Forced
extortions by kings are not properly
debts of the state. The sanction of
the people, through its representatives,
is required to make repayment
binding upon the people. The practice
which the Revolution introduced
was the contraction of debt, not intended
to be liquidated by the borrowing
generation, but to be carried
over so as to affect the industry of
generations unborn; not to make the
debtor pay, but to leave the payment
to his posterity.</p>

<p>When William and Mary were proclaimed,
there was no such thing as
a national debt. We may indeed
except a comparatively small sum,
amounting to above half a million,
which had been detained in exchequer
by the profligate Charles II.,
and applied to his own uses. But
this was not properly a state debt,
nor was it acknowledged as such till
a later period.</p>

<p>To those who are capable of appreciating
that genius which is never so
strongly shown as in connexion with
political affairs, the conduct of William
is a most interesting study. It
would be impossible to exaggerate his
qualities of clear-sightedness and decision;
or to select a more forcible
instance of that ascendency which
a man of consummate discernment
and forethought may attain, in spite
of every opposition. He had, in truth,
very difficult cards to play. The different
parties, both religious and political,
throughout the nation, were so
strongly opposed to each other, that
it seemed impossible to adopt any
line of conduct, which should not, by
favouring one, give mortal umbrage
to the others. It was reserved for
William, by a master-stroke of policy,
to create a new party by new means,
which in time should absorb the
others; and to strengthen his government
by attaching to it the commercial
classes, by a tie which is ever the
strongest&mdash;that of deep pecuniary interest
in the stability of existing
affairs. At the same time he was
most desirous, without materially increasing
the taxation of England, to
raise such sums of money as might
enable him to prosecute his darling
object of striking a death-blow at the
ascendency of France. The scheme
answered well&mdash;possibly beyond his
most sanguine expectation. Nor was
it altogether without a precedent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In Holland," says Mr Doubleday,
"the country of his birth, the Dutch
king and his advisers found both a precedent
to quote, and an example to follow.
By its position and circumstances,
this country, inconsiderable in size and
population, and not naturally defensible,
had been compelled to act the part, for
a series of years, of a leading power in
Europe; and this it had only been
enabled to do, by that novel arm which a
very extensive foreign trade is sure to
create, and by the money drawn together
by successful trading. Venice had at an
earlier period played a similar part; but
a series of struggles at last led the huckstering
genius of the Dutch into a system
at which the Venetian public had not
arrived: and this was the fabrication of
paper money, the erection of a bank to
issue it, and the systematic borrowing of
that money, and the creation of debt on
the part of government, for only the
interest of which taxes were demanded
of the people. Here was machinery set
up and at work; and, in the opinion of
interested and superficial observers, working
successfully. It was, accordingly,
soon proposed to set up a copy of this
machinery in England, and in 1694, the
blow was struck which was destined to
have effects so monstrous, so long continued,
and so marvellous, on the fortunes
of England and her people; and the
establishment, since known as the Bank of
England, was erected under the sanction
of the government."</p></blockquote>

<p>The worst and most dangerous
feature of a permanent national debt
is, that, during the earlier stages of its
existence, an appearance of factitious
prosperity is generated, and the nation
consequently blinded to its remote
but necessary results. The tendency
to such a delusion is inherent in
human nature. <i>Après nous le deluge!</i>
is a sorry maxim, which has been
often acted on, if not quoted by statesmen,
who, like a certain notable Scottish
provost, being unable to discover
anything that posterity has done for
them, have thought themselves entitled
to deal as they pleased with
posterity. The proceeds of the earlier
loans enabled William to carry on his
wars; and the nation, puffed up with
pride, looked upon the new discovery
as something far more important and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_663">663</span>
valuable than the opening of another
Indies. Nor did William confine
himself merely to loans. Lotteries,
tontines, long and short annuities,
and every species of device for raising
money, were patronised and urged on
by the former Stadtholder, and the
rage for public gambling became uncontrollable
and universal. As we
have just emerged from one of those
periodical fits of speculation which
seem epidemical in Great Britain, and
which, in fact, have been so ever since
the Revolution, it may be interesting
to the reader to know, that the introduction
of the new system was marked
by precisely the same social phenomena
which were observable four years
ago, when the shares in every bubble
railway scheme commanded a ridiculous
premium. We quote from the
work of Mr Francis:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The moneyed interest&mdash;a title familiar
to the reader of the present day&mdash;was
unknown until 1692. It was then arrogated
by those who saw the great advantage
of entering into transactions in the
funds for the aid of government. The
title claimed by them in pride was employed
by others in derision; and the
purse-proud importance of men grown
suddenly rich was a common source of
ridicule. Wealth rapidly acquired has
been invariably detrimental to the manners
and the morals of the nation, and in
1692 the rule was as absolute as now.
The moneyed interest, intoxicated by the
possession of wealth, which their wildest
dreams had never imagined, and incensed
by the cold contempt with which the
landed interest treated them, endeavoured
to rival the latter in that magnificence
which was one characteristic of the landed
families. Their carriages were radiant
with gold; their persons were radiant
with gems; they married the poorer
branches of the nobility; they eagerly
purchased the princely mansions of the
old aristocracy. The brush of Sir Godfrey
Kneller, and the chisel of Caius Cibber,
were employed in perpetuating their
features. Their wealth was rarely grudged
to humble the pride of a Howard or a
Cavendish; and the money gained by the
father was spent by the son in acquiring
a distinction at the expense of decency."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is curious to remark that the
Stock Exchange cannot be said to
have had any period of minority. It
leaped out at once full-armed, like
Minerva from the brain of Jupiter.
All the arts of <i>bulling</i> and <i>bearing</i>, of
false rumours, of expresses, combinations,
squeezings&mdash;all that constitute
the mystery of Mammon, were known
as well to the fathers of the Alley, as
they are to their remote representatives.
Nay, it would almost appear that
the patriarchal jobber had more genius
than has since been inherited. William's
retinue did not consist only of
mercenaries and refugees. Hovering
on the skirts of his army came the sons
of Israel, with beaks whetted for the
prey, and appetites which never can
be sated. <i>Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona</i>&mdash;there
were earlier vultures than
Nathan Rothschild. The principal
negotiators of the first British loan
were Jews. They assisted the Stadtholder
with their counsel, and a Mephistopheles
of the money-making
race attached himself even to the side
of Marlborough. According to Mr
Francis:&mdash;"The wealthy Hebrew,
Medina, accompanied Marlborough in
all his campaigns; administered to the
avarice of the great captain by an
annuity of six thousand pounds per
annum; repaid himself by expresses
containing intelligence of those great
battles which fire the English blood
to hear them named; and Ramilies,
Oudenarde, and Blenheim, administered
as much to the purse of the
Hebrew as they did to the glory of
England."</p>

<p>It has been estimated, upon good
authority, that from fifteen to twenty
per cent of every loan raised in England,
has, directly or indirectly, found
its way to the coffers of those unconscionable
Shylocks; so that it is small
wonder if we hear of colossal fortunes
coexisting with extreme national depreciation
and distress. We might,
indeed, estimate their profits at a much
higher rate. Dr Charles Davenant,
in his essay on the <i>Balance of Trade</i>,
written in the earlier part of the last
century, remarked&mdash;"While these
immense debts remain, the necessities
of the government will continue, interest
must be high, and large premiums
will be given. And what encouragement
is there for men to think of
foreign traffic (whose returns for those
commodities that enrich England must
bring no great profit to the private
adventurers) when they can sit at
home, and, without any care or hazard,
get from the state, by dealing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_664">664</span>
with the exchequer, fifteen, and sometimes
twenty, thirty, forty, and fifty
per cent? Is there any commerce
abroad so constantly advantageous?"
We apprehend not. Capital is defined
by the economists as the accumulation
of the savings of industry. Such men
as Rothschild have no doubt been
industrious, but not according to the
ordinary acceptation of the term.
Their industry is of a wholesale kind.
It is confined to a resolute and systematic
endeavour to avail themselves
of the savings of others; and we need
hardly state that, in this pursuit, they
have shown themselves most eminently
successful.</p>

<p>The remarkable change which took
place in the monetary system of England,
under the auspices of William,
could not, of course, have been effected
without the concurrence of parliament.
That body had certainly no reason to
charge him with neglect of their interests.
The representatives of the
people for the first time began to
understand, that there might be certain
perquisites arising from their
situation as men of trust, which could
be made available to them, provided
they were not too scrupulous as to the
requirements of the crown. The mastiff
which had bayed so formidably at
James and his predecessors, because
none of them would deign to cajole
him, became at once amenable to a
sop. Mr Macaulay should have written:
"The revolution of 1688 did not
introduce the practice of regularly
summoning parliaments; what it introduced
was the practice of regularly
bribing them." Mr Francis, though
an apologist of King William, who, as
he thinks, was compelled to act thus
from imperious necessity, is not blind
to this stigma on his memory. He
also believes that the settled animosity
between England and France, which
has caused so many wars, and led to
such an extravagant expenditure of
blood and treasure, is mainly to be
attributed to the persevering efforts of
William of Orange. The following
summary is of much interest:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The parliamentary records of William's
reign are curious. The demands
which he made for money, the hatred to
France which he encouraged, and the frequent
supplies he received, are remarkable
features in his history. Every art
was employed; at one time a mild remonstrance,
at another a haughty menace, at
a third the reproach that he had ventured
his life for the benefit of the country.
The bribery, during this reign, was the
commencement of a system which has been
very injurious to the credit and character
of England. The support of the members
was purchased with places, with contracts,
with titles, with promises, with portions
of the loans, and with tickets in the lottery.
The famous axiom of Sir Robert
Walpole was a practice and a principle
with William; he found that custom could
not stale the infinite variety of its effect,
and that, so long as bribes continued, so
long would supplies be free. Exorbitant
premiums were given for money; and so
low was public credit, <i>that of five millions
granted to carry on the war, only two and
a half millions reach the Exchequer</i>. Long
annuities and short annuities, lottery
tickets and irredeemable debts, made their
frequent appearance; and the duties,
which principally date from this period,
were most pernicious."</p></blockquote>

<p>These things are elements of importance
in considering the political history
of the country. They explain the
reason why the great bulk of the
nation never cordially supported the
new succession; and why, for the
first time in English history, their
own representative house lost caste
and credit with the commons. Fifty
years later, when Charles Edward
penetrated into the heart of England,
he met with no opposition. If the inhabitants
of the counties through
which he passed did not join his standard,
they thought as little of making
tiny active opposition to his advance;
thereby exhibiting an apathy totally
at variance with the high national and
independent spirit which in all times
has characterised the English, and to
be accounted for on no other ground
than their disgust with the new system
which, even then, had swollen the
amount of taxation to an extent
seriously felt by the commonalty, and
which had so corrupted parliament
that redress seemed hopeless within
the peaceful limits of the constitution.
The proclamation issued by the prince,
from Edinburgh, bore direct reference
to the funded debt, and to the notorious
ministerial bribery; and it must
have found an echo in the hearts of
many, who began to perceive that the
cry of civil and religious liberty is
the standard stalking-horse for every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_665">665</span>
revolution, but that the result of revolutions
is too commonly an imperative
demand upon the people for a large
augmentation of their burdens, backed
too by the very demagogues who were
the instigators of the violent change.
In this crisis, the moneyed interest,
which William had so dexterously
created, saved the new dynasty&mdash;less,
certainly, from patriotism, than from
the fear of personal ruin.</p>

<p>It is a memorable fact that, from
the very first, the Tory party opposed
themselves strenuously to the creation
and progress of the national debt. It
is well that those who, in our own
times, bitterly denounce the system
which has landed us in such inextricable
difficulties, and which has had
the effect of rearing up class interests,
irreconcilably opposed to each other,
in once-united England, should remember
that for all this legacy we are
specially indebted to the Whigs.
Except by Tory ministers, and in one
case by Walpole, no attempt has
been made to stem the progress of the
current; and this consideration is
doubly valuable at this moment, when
it is proposed, by a vigorous effort, to
make head against the monster grievance,
and, by the establishment of an
inviolable sinking-fund, to commence
that work which liberal and juggling
politicians have hitherto shamefully
evaded. It is more than probable that
"the moneyed interest" will throw the
whole weight of their influence in
opposition to any such movement;
unless, indeed, they should begin
already to perceive that there may be
worse evils in store for them than a
just liquidation of their claims. Matters
have now gone so far as to be
perilous, if no practicable mode of
ultimate extrication can be shown.
Real property cannot be taxed any
higher&mdash;indeed, the landowners have
claims for relief from peculiar burdens
imposed upon them, which in equity
can hardly be gainsaid. The property
and income-tax, admittedly an impolitic
impost in the time of peace,
cannot remain long on its present footing.
To tax professional earnings at
the same rate as the profits of accumulated
capital, is a manifest and gross injustice
against which people are beginning
to rebel. There is no choice left,
except between direct taxation and a
recurrence to the system which we
have abandoned, of raising the greater
part of our revenue by duties upon
foreign imports. The former method,
now openly advocated by the financial
reformers, is, in our opinion, a direct
step towards repudiation. Let the
fundholders look to it in time, and
judge for themselves what results are
likely to accrue from such a policy.
One thing is clear, that if no effort
should be made to redeem any portion
of the debt&mdash;but if, on the contrary,
circumstances should arise, the probability
of which is before us even
now, to call for its augmentation, and
for a corresponding increase of the
public revenue&mdash;the financial reformers
will not be slow to discover that the
only interest hitherto unassailed must
submit to suffer in its turn. The
Whigs are now brought to such a pass,
that they cannot hope to see their
way to a surplus. We shall have no
more of those annual remissions of duties,
which for years past have been
made the boast of every budget, but to
which, in reality, the greater part of our
present difficulties is owing. Had a
sinking fund been established long
ago, and rigidly maintained, and at the
same time the revenue kept full, the nation
would ere now have been reaping
the benefit of such a policy. We should
have had the satisfaction of seeing our
debt annually diminishing, and the interest
of it becoming less; whereas, by the
wretched system of fiddling popularity
which has been pursued, the debt has
augmented in time of peace, the annual
burdens absolutely increased, ruinous
competition been fostered, and internal
jealousies excited. The Whigs,
who arrogate for themselves, not only
now but in former times, the guardianship
of the liberties of Britain, have
taken especial pains to conceal the
fact that they were, in reality, the
authors of our funding system, and
the bitterest opponents of those who
early descried its remote and ruinous
consequences. Their motives cannot
be concealed, however it may be their
interest at the present time to gloss
them over. Lord Bolingbroke thus
exposes their occult designs, in his
"<i>Letters on the Use of History</i>."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Few men, at the time (1688), looked
forward enough to foresee the necessary
consequences of the new constitution of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_666">666</span>
the revenue that was soon afterwards
formed, nor of the method of funding that
immediately took place; which, absurd
as they are, have continued ever since,
till it is become scarce possible to alter
them. Few people, I say, saw how the
creation of funds, and the multiplication
of taxes, would increase yearly the power
of the Crown, and bring our liberties, by
a natural and necessary progression, into
more real though less apparent danger
than they were in before the Revolution!
The excessive ill husbandry practised
from the very beginning of King William's
reign, and which laid the foundation
of all we feel and fear, was not the
effect of ignorance, mistake, or what we call
chance, <i>but of design and scheme in those
who had the sway at the time</i>. I am not
so uncharitable, however, as to believe
that they intended to bring upon their
country all the mischiefs that we who
came after them experience and apprehend.
No: they saw the measures they
took singly and unrelatively, or relatively
alone to some immediate object. The
notion of attaching men to the new government,
by tempting them to embark
their fortunes on the same bottom, was a
reason of state to some; the notion of
creating a new, that is, a moneyed interest,
in opposition to the landed interest, or as a
balance to it, and of acquiring a superior
interest in the city of London at least, by
the establishment of great corporations, was
a reason of party to others: and I make
no doubt that the opportunity of amassing
immense estates, by the management of
funds, by trafficking in paper, and by all
the arts of jobbing, was a reason of private
interest to those who supported and
improved that scheme of iniquity, if not
to those who devised it. They looked
no further. Nay, we who came after
them, and have long tasted the bitter
fruits of the corruption they planted,
were far from taking such alarm at our
distress and our dangers as they deserved."</p></blockquote>

<p>In like manner wrote Swift, and
Hume, and Smith; nor need we wonder
at their vehemence, when we direct
our attention to the rapid increase
of the charge. William's legacy was
£16,400,000 of debt, at an annual
charge to the nation of about
£1,311,000. At the death of Queen
Anne, the debt amounted to fifty-four
millions, and the interest to three millions,
three hundred and fifty thousand&mdash;being
nearly double the <i>whole
revenue</i> raised by King James! The
total amount of the annual revenue
under Queen Anne, was more than
five millions and a half. Under
George I., singular to relate, there
was no increase of the debt. At the
close of the reign of George II., it
amounted to about a hundred and
forty millions; and, in 1793, just one
hundred years after the introduction
of the funding system in Britain, we
find it at two hundred and fifty-two
millions, with an interest approaching
to ten. Twenty-two years later, that
amount was more than trebled. These
figures may well awaken grave consideration
in the bosoms of all of us.
The past is irremediable; and it would
be a gross and unpardonable error to
conclude, that a large portion of the
sum thus raised and expended was
uselessly thrown away; or that the
corruption employed by the founders
of the system, to secure the acquiescence
of parliament, was of long continuance.
On the contrary, it is undeniable
that the result of many of
the wars in which Britain engaged
has been her commercial, territorial,
and political aggrandisement; and that
bribery, in a direct form, is now most
happily unknown. The days have
gone by since the parliamentary guests
of Walpole could calculate on finding
a note for £500, folded up in their
dinner napkins&mdash;since great companies,
applying for a charter, were compelled
to purchase support&mdash;or when peace
could only be obtained, as in the following
instance, by means of purchased
votes:&mdash;"The peace of 1763," said
John Ross Mackay, private secretary
to the Earl of Bute, and afterwards
Treasurer to the Ordnance, "was carried
through, and approved, by a pecuniary
distribution. Nothing else
could have surmounted the difficulty.
I was myself the channel through
which the money passed. With my
own hand I secured above one hundred
and twenty votes on that vital
question. Eighty thousand pounds
was set apart for the purpose. Forty
members of the House of Commons
received from me a thousand pounds
each. To eighty others I paid five
hundred pounds a-piece." Still we
cannot disguise the fact, that a vast
amount of the treasure so levied, and
for every shilling of which the industry
of the nation was mortgaged,
never reached the coffers of the state,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_667">667</span>
but passed in the shape of bonuses,
premiums, and exorbitant contracts,
to rear up those fortunes which have
been the wonder and admiration of
the world. Nor is it less palpable
that the fortunes so constructed could
not have had existence, unless abstracted
from the regular industry of
the country, to the inevitable detriment
of the labourer, whose condition
has at all times received by far too
little consideration. Add to this the
spirit of public gambling, which, since
the Revolution, has manifested itself
periodically in this country&mdash;the sudden
fever-fits which seem to possess
the middle classes of the community,
and, by conjuring up visions of unbounded
and unbased wealth, without
the necessary preliminary of labour,
to extinguish their wonted prudence&mdash;and
we must conclude that the
funding system has been pregnant
with social and moral evils which
have extended to the whole community.
Before we pass from this subject&mdash;which
we have dwelt upon at considerable
length, believing it of deep
interest at the present point of our
financial history&mdash;we would request
the attention of our readers to the
following extract from the work of
Mr Francis, as condemnatory of the
policy pursued by recent governments,
and as tending to throw light on the
ultimate designs of the Financial Reform
Associations. It is quite possible
that, in matters of detail, we
might not agree with the writer&mdash;at
least, he has given us no means of
ascertaining upon what principles he
would base an "efficient revision of
our taxation;" but we cordially agree
with him in thinking that, as we presently
stand, the right arm of Great
Britain is tied up, and the Bank of
England, under its present restrictions,
in extreme jeopardy at the first announcement
of a war.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is one great evil of the present age,
that it persists in regarding the debt as
perpetual. Immediately the expenditure
is exceeded by the revenue, there is a
demand for the reduction of taxation.
We, a commercial people, brought up at
the feet of M'Culloch, with the books of
national debt as a constant study, with
the interest on the national debt as a constant
remembrancer, persist in scoffing at
any idea of decreasing the encumbrance:
and when a Chancellor of the Exchequer
proposes a loan of eight millions, we
growl and grumble, call it charitable,
trust for better times, and read the Opposition
papers with renewed zest.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the resources
of the nation are equal to far more than
is now imposed; but it can only be done
by an efficient revision of our taxation,
and this will never be effected till the
wolf is at the door. A war which greatly
increased our yearly imposts would, with
the present system, crush the artisan,
paralyse the middle class, and scarcely
leave the landed proprietor unscathed.
The convertibility of the note of the Bank
of England would cease; and it would be
impossible to preserve the charter of Sir
Robert Peel in its entirety, while twenty-eight
millions were claimable yearly in
specie, and the gold of the country went
abroad in subsidies.</p>

<p>In an earlier portion of the volume,
the writer briefly advocated annuities as
one mode of treating the national debt.
There would in this be no breach of faith
to the present public; there would be no
dread of a general bankruptcy; there
would be no need of loans; and, had this
principle been carried out, the national
debt would be yearly diminishing. In
ten years, nearly two millions of terminable
annuities will expire, and it behoves
the government to inquire into the effect
which the conversion of the interminable
debt into terminable annuities would
have on the money market.</p>

<p>It is absolutely idle for the Financial
Reform Association to think of effectually
lowering the taxation of the country,
while twenty-eight millions are paid for
interest; and it is to be feared that great
evil will accompany whatever good they
may achieve. That there are many offices
which might be abolished; that it is a
rule in England that the least worked
should be best paid; that an extravagant
system of barbaric grandeur exists; that
the army and the navy, the pulpit and the
bar, are conducted unwisely; and that
great men are paid great salaries for doing
nothing,&mdash;is indisputable; but it is
equally so that great savings have been
effected, and that greater efforts are
making to economise further. There is
a faith pledged to the public servant as
much as to the public creditor; and,
whether he be a colonel or a clerk, a
man of peace or a man of war, it is
impracticable, imprudent, and unjust to
attempt that which would as much break
faith with him, as to cease to pay the
dividends on the national debt would be
to break faith with the national creditor.</p>

<p>These things are paltry and puerile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_668">668</span>
compared with that which, excepting a
total revision of taxation, can alone
materially meet the difficulties of England;
and the gentlemen of the Reform
Association are aware of this. They
may cut down salaries; lower the defences
of the country; abolish expensive
forms and ceremonies; amalgamate
a few boards of direction; reduce the
civil list; and do away with all sinecures.
But the evil is too vast, and the difficulties
are too gigantic, to be met in so
simple a manner. Nor will these gentlemen
be satisfied with it while there are
eight hundred millions at which to level
their Quixotic spear. Repudiation was
darkly alluded to at one meeting of the
Association, and, though it has since been
denied, it is to be feared that time only
is required to ripen the attempt."</p></blockquote>

<p>Turn we now from the national
debt to its eldest offspring, the Exchange.
Marvellous indeed are the
scenes to which we are introduced,
whether we read its history as in the
time of William of Orange, enter it at
the period when the South Sea bubble
had reached its utmost width of distension,
or tread its precincts at a more
recent date, when railway speculation
was at its height, and the Glenmutchkin
at a noble premium. John Bunyan
could not have had a glimpse of it, for
he died in 1688: nevertheless his
Vanity Fair is no inaccurate prototype
of its doings. No stranger, indeed,
may enter the secret place where its
prime mysteries are enacted: if any
uninitiated wight should by chance or
accident set foot within that charmed
circle, the alarm is given as rapidly as
in Alsatia when a bailiff trespassed
upon the sanctuary. With a shout of
"Fourteen hundred fives!" the slogan
of their clan, Jew, Gentile, and proselyte
precipitate themselves upon the
rash intruder. In the twinkling of an
eye, his hat is battered down, and
amidst kicks, cuffs, and bustling, he is
ejected from the temple of Mammon.
But, lingering in the outer court and
vestibule, we can gain some glimpses
of the interior worship; imperfect,
indeed, but such as may well deter us
from aspiring to form part of the congregation.</p>

<p>The creation and transferable character
of public funds, necessarily involved
the existence of a class of men
who deal in such securities. That class
multiplied apace, and multiplied so
much that, after a time, the commissions
exigible for each <i>boná fide</i> transaction
could not afford a decent subsistence
for all who were engaged in
the business. People who buy into
the stocks with a view to permanent
investment, are not usually in a hurry
to sell; and this branch of the profession,
though, strictly speaking, the
only legitimate one, could not be very
lucrative. Gambling was soon introduced.
The fluctuations in the price
of the funds, which were frequent in
those unsettled times, presented an
irresistible temptation to buying and
selling for the account&mdash;a process by
means of which a small capital may be
made to represent fictitiously an enormous
amount of stock: no transfers
being required, and in fact no sales
created, the real stake being the difference
between the buying and the
selling prices. But, the natural fluctuations
of the stocks not affording a
sufficient margin for the avarice of the
speculators, all sorts of deep-laid
schemes were hatched to elevate or
depress them unnaturally. In other
words, fraud was resorted to, from a
very early period, for the purpose of
promoting gain. The following may
serve as an example:&mdash;"The first
political hoax on record occurred in
the reign of Anne. Down the Queen's
road, riding at a furious rate, ordering
turnpikes to be thrown open, and loudly
proclaiming the sudden death of the
Queen, rode a well-dressed man, sparing
neither spur nor steed. From west
to east, and from north to south, the
news spread. Like wildfire it passed
through the desolate fields where
palaces now abound, till it reached
the City. The train-bands desisted
from their exercise, furled their colours,
and returned home with their arms
reversed. The funds fell with a suddenness
which marked the importance of
the intelligence; and it was remarked
that, while the Christian jobbers stood
aloof, almost paralysed with the information,
Manasseh Lopez and the
Jew interest bought eagerly at the
reduced price." The whole thing was
a lie, coined by the astute Hebrews,
who then, as now, accumulated the
greater part of their money in this
disgraceful and infamous manner, and
doubtless had the audacity even to
glory in their shame. A more ingenious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_669">669</span>
trick was played off in 1715, when
a sham capture was made in Scotland
of a carriage and six, supposed to
contain the unfortunate Chevalier St
George. The news, being despatched
to London, instantly elevated the funds,
"and the inventors of the trick laughed
in their sleeves as they divided the
profit." Modern jobbers will doubtless
read these records with a sigh for the
glory of departed times, just as a
schoolboy bitterly regrets that he was
not born in the days of chivalry.
Universal rapidity of communication,
and the power of the press, have rendered
such operations on a large scale
almost impossible. The electric telegraph
has injured the breed of carrier
pigeons, and more than half the poetry
of fraudulent stock-jobbing has disappeared.</p>

<p>The range of the jobbers speedily
extended itself beyond the comparatively
narrow field presented by the
funds. Exchequer bills with a
variable premium were invented and
brought into the market, a large and
lucrative business was done in lottery
tickets, and even seats in parliament
were negotiated on the Stock Exchange.
Joint-stock companies next
came into play, and these have ever
since proved an inexhaustible mine
of wealth to the jobbers. Nor were
they in the least particular as to the
nature of the commodity in which
they dealt. Thomas Guy, founder
of the hospital called after his name,
acquired his fortune by means similar
to those which are now made matter
of reproach to the Jews of Portsmouth
and Plymouth. It is a curious feature
in the history of mankind, that
money questionably amassed is more
often destined to pious uses than the
savings of honest industry. The conscience
of the usurer becomes alarmed
as the hour of dissolution draws nigh.
"His principal dealings were in those
tickets with which, from the time of
the second Charles, the seamen had
been remunerated. After years of
great endurance, and of greater
labour, the defenders of the land were
paid with inconvertible paper; and
the seamen, too often improvident,
were compelled to part with their
wages at any discount, which the conscience
of the usurer would offer.
Men who had gone the round of the
world like Drake, or had fought hand
to hand with Tromp, were unable to
compete with the keen agent of the
usurer, who, decoying them into the
low haunts of Rotherhithe, purchased
their tickets at the lowest possible
price; and skilled seamen, the glory
of England's navy, were thus robbed,
and ruined, and compelled to transfer
their services to foreign states. In
these tickets did Thomas Guy deal,
and on the savings of these men was
the vast superstructure of his fortune
reared. But jobbing in them was as
frequent in the high places of England
as in 'Change Alley. The seaman
was poor and uninfluential, and the
orders which were refused payment to
him were paid to the wealthy jobber,
who parted with some of his plunder
as a premium to the treasury to disgorge
the remainder." But frauds
and injustice, even when countenanced
by governments, have rarely
other than a disastrous issue to the
state. So in the case of those seamen's
tickets. That the wages due
to the sailor should have fallen into
arrears during the reigns of Charles
and of James, need excite little surprise,
when we remember that the
revenue in their day never exceeded
two millions annually. But that the
abuse should have been continued
after the revolutionary government
had discovered its easy method of
raising subsidies&mdash;more especially
when ample proof had been given of
the danger of such a system, by the
want of alacrity displayed by the
English seamen when the Dutch fleet
burned our vessels in the Thames and
threatened Chatham&mdash;is indeed matter
of marvel, and speaks volumes as
to the gross corruption of the times.
So infamous was the neglect, that at
length the sailors' tickets had accumulated
to the amount of nine millions
sterling of arrears. Not one farthing
had been provided to meet this huge
demand; and in order to stay the
clamours of the holders&mdash;not now
mariners, but men of the stamp of
Thomas Guy,&mdash;parliament erected
them into that body known as the
South Sea Company, the transactions
of which will ever be memorable in
the commercial history of Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The existence of this company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_670">670</span>
dates from the reign of Queen Anne;
but for some years its operations were
conducted on a small scale, and it
only assumed importance in 1719,
when exclusive privileges of trading
within certain latitudes were assured
to it. We quote from Mr Doubleday
the following particulars, which utterly
eclipse the grandeur of modern
gambling and duplicity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As soon as the act had fairly passed
the Houses, the stock of the company at
once rose to <i>three hundred and nineteen
per cent</i>; and a mad epidemic of speculative
gambling seemed, at once, to seize
the whole nation, with the exception of
Mr Hutchison, and a few others, who not
only preserved their sanity, but energetically
warned the public of the ultimate
fate of the scheme and its dupes. The
public, however, was deaf. The first
sales of stock by the Court of Directors
were made at three hundred per cent.
Two millions and a quarter were taken,
and the market price at one reached
<i>three hundred and forty</i>&mdash;double the first
instalment according to the terms of
payment. To set out handsomely, the
Court voted a dividend of ten per cent
upon South Sea Stock, being only a
half-yearly dividend, payable at midsummer
1720. To enable persons to hold,
they also offered to lend half a million
on security of their own stock; and
afterwards increased the amount to a
million, or nearly so. These bold steps
gained the whole affair such an increase
of credit, that, upon a bare notice that
certain irredeemable annuities would be
received for stock, upon terms hereafter
to be settled, numbers of annuitants deposited
their securities at the South Sea
House, without knowing the terms!
About June, when the first half-yearly
dividend was becoming due, the frenzy
rose to such a pitch, that the stock was
sold at <i>eight hundred and ninety per cent</i>.
This extravagance, however, made so many
sellers, that the price suddenly fell, and
uneasiness began to be manifested; when
the Directors had the inconceivable audacity
to propose to create new stock at <i>one
thousand per cent</i>, to be paid in ten instalments
of one hundred pounds each.
Strange to relate, this desperate villany
turned the tide again, and, to use the
words of Anderson, 'in a few days the
hundred pound instalment was worth
<i>four hundred</i>!'"</p></blockquote>

<p>We invariably find that the success,
whether real or pretended, of any one
scheme, gives rise to a host of imitations.
If any new company, whatever be its
object, is started, and the shares are
selling at a premium, we may look
with perfect confidence for the announcement
of six or seven others
before as many days have elapsed.
This is, of course, partly owing to the
cupidity of the public; but that cupidity
could not manifest itself so soon in a
tangible form, but for the machinations
of certain parties, who see their way
to a profit whatever may be the result
of the speculation. Amidst the
ruin and desolation which invariably
follow those seasons of infuriated and
infatuated gambling, to which we are
now almost habituated, such men preserve
a tranquil and a calm demeanour.
And no wonder: they have
reaped the harvest which the folly of
others has sown. At the hottest and
most exciting period of the game,
they have their senses as completely
under control as the sharper who has
deliberately dined on chicken and
lemonade, with the prospect of encountering
afterwards an inebriated
victim at Crockford's. They may
play largely, but they only do so while
their hand is safe; the moment luck
changes, they sell out, and leave the
whole loss to be borne by the unfortunate
dupes, who, believing in their
deliberate falsehoods, still continue to
hold on, trusting to the advent of those
fabulous better times which, in their
case, never can arrive. It has been
so in our own times, and it was so
when the South Sea bubble was expanding
on its visionary basis. Multitudes
of minor schemes were projected,
subscribed for, and driven up
to an exorbitant premium. The
shares of really solid companies participated
in the rise, and mounted
correspondingly in the market. The
nominal value of all the sorts of
stock then afloat was computed at no
less than five hundred millions; being
exactly double the estimated value of
the whole lands, houses, and real property
in the kingdom!</p>

<p>The collapse came, and brought ruin
to thousands who thought that they
held fortune within their grasp.
The history of the downfall is not less
suggestive than that of the rapid rise.
It has had its parallel in our days,
when the most rotten and unsubstantial
of companies have brazened out
their frauds to the last, doctored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_671">671</span>
accounts, declared fictitious dividends,
and threatened with legal prosecution
those who had the courage and the
honesty to expose them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The minor bubbles burst first, when
the South Sea schemers were foolish
enough to apply for a <i>scire facias</i> against
their projectors, on the ground that <i>their</i>
schemes injured the credit of the grand
scheme. This turned quondam allies into
furious enemies. The <i>scire facias</i> was issued
on 13th August 1720, when the
downfall began; and Mr Hutchison saw
his predictions completely fulfilled. The
South Sea villains, in sheer desperation,
declared a <i>half-yearly dividend of thirty
per cent</i> due at Christmas, and offered to
guarantee fifty per cent per annum for
twelve years! They might as well have
declared it for the thirtieth of February.
Everything was done to prop the reputation
of the directors, but all was in vain;
and when the stock fell at last to one
hundred and seventy-five, a panic ensued,
and all went to the ground together, totally
ruining thousands, and nearly dragging
the Bank and East India Company
along with it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Francis gives us some interesting
anecdotes of the casualties arising
from this gigantic scheme of imposture.
Gay, the author of the <i>Beggar's
Opera</i>, was a holder of stock,
and at one time might have sold out
with a profit of twenty thousand
pounds&mdash;an opportunity very rarely
vouchsafed to a poet. In spite of
shrewd advice, he neglected his chance,
and lost every penny. One Hudson,
a native of Yorkshire, who had succeeded
to a large fortune, went deeply
into the scheme. From a millionnaire
he became a beggar and insane,
and wandered through the streets of
London a pitiable object of charity.
But it would be work, of supererogation
to multiply instances of similar
calamity. They are reproduced over
and over again at the conclusion of
every fit of wild and reckless speculation;
and yet the warning, terrible as
it is, seems to have no effect in restraining
the morbid appetite.</p>

<p>It would, we apprehend, be impossible
to find any one who will advocate
gambling upon principle; though
a multitude of excellent persons, who
would shrink with horror were the
odious epithet applied to them, are,
nevertheless, as much gamblers as if
they were staking their money at
<i>rouge-et-noir</i> or <i>roulette</i>. The man
who buys into a public stock with the
intention of selling in a week or a
fortnight, in the expectation of doing
so at an advanced price, or the
other who sells shares which he does
not possess, in the confident belief of
a speedy fall, is, in everything save
decency of appearance, on a par with
the haunter of the casino. He may,
if he so pleases, designate himself an
investor, but, in reality, he is a common
gamester. This may be a hard
truth, but it is a wholesome one, and
it cannot be too often repeated, at a
time when general usage, and yielding
to temptation, have perverted
words from their ordinary significance,
and led many of us to justify transactions
which, when tried by the
standard of morality, and stripped of
their disguise, ought to be unhesitatingly
condemned. "He that loveth
gold shall not be justified," said the
son of Sirach. "Many have sinned
for a small matter; and he that seeketh
for abundance will turn his eyes
away. As a nail sticketh fast between
the joinings of the stones, so
doth sin stick close between buying
and selling." This spirit, when it
becomes general in the nation, cannot
be otherwise than most hurtful to its
welfare, since it diverts the thoughts
of many from those industrial pursuits
which are profitable to themselves
and others, and leads them
astray from that honourable and upright
course which is the sure and
only road to wealth, happiness, and
esteem. This has been, to a certain
extent, acknowledged by government,
even within our own time. The pernicious
effect of the lotteries, originally,
a state device, upon the morals and
condition of the lower classes, as testified
by the vast increase of crime,
became at length so glaring, that these
detestable engines of fraud were suppressed
by act of parliament. They
still linger on the Continent, as most
of us have reason to know from the
annual receipt of documents, copiously
circulated by the Jews of Hamburg
and Frankfort, offering us, in exchange
for a few florins, the chance of
becoming proprietors of several chateaux
on the Rhine, with boar-forests,
mineral springs, vineyards, and other
appurtenances. We presume, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_672">672</span>
the continuity of the circulars, that
Israel still finds its dupes; but we
never happened, save in one of Charles
Lever's novels, to hear of any person
lucky enough to stumble on the ticket
which secured the right to Henkersberg,
Bettlersbad, or Narrenstein. The
extent to which lottery gambling was
carried in this country seems to us
absolutely incredible. Derby sweeps
were nothing to it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1772," says Mr Francis, "lottery
magazine proprietors, lottery tailors, lottery
staymakers, lottery glovers, lottery
hatmakers, lottery tea merchants, lottery
barbers&mdash;where a man, for being shaved
and paying threepence, stood a chance of
receiving £10; lottery shoeblacks, lottery
eating-houses&mdash;where, for sixpence, a
plate of meat and the chance of 60 guineas
were given; lottery oyster-stalls&mdash;where
threepence gave a supply of oysters,
and a remote chance of five guineas, were
plentiful; and, to complete a catalogue
which speaks volumes, at a sausage-stall,
in a narrow alley, was the important intimation
written up, that, for one farthing's
worth of sausages, the fortunate
purchaser might realise a capital of five
shillings. Quack doctors, a class which
formed so peculiar a feature in village
life of old, sold medicine at a high price,
giving those who purchased it tickets in
a lottery purporting to contain silver and
other valuable prizes."</p></blockquote>

<p>A new discovery was presently
made, which had a serious effect upon
trade.  Money-prizes were discontinued,
and shopkeepers, parcelling
out their goods, disposed of them by
lottery. As a matter of course, this
business, commenced by disreputable
adventurers, proved most injurious to
the regular dealer.  People refused to
buy an article at the regular price,
when it might be obtained for next to
nothing.  They were, however, utterly
wrong, for the staple of the prize
goods, when inspected, proved to be
of the most flimsy description. Tickets
in the state lotteries became the subject
of pawn, and were so received by
the brokers, and even by the bankers.
Suicide was rife; forgery grew common;
theft increased enormously.
Husbands and fathers saw their wives
and children reduced to absolute starvation,
and weeping bitterly for bread,
and yet pawned their last articles of
household furniture for one more desperate
chance in the lottery. Wives
betrayed their husbands, and plundered
them, for the same purpose. Servants
robbed their masters; commissions
and offices were sold. Insurance was
resorted to, to accommodate
all classes. Those who had not money
to pay for tickets might insure a certain
number for a small sum, and thus
obtain a prize; and so lottery grew
upon lottery, and the sphere was indefinitely
extended. It was not until
1826 that this abominable system,
was finally crushed. The image of
the vans, placards, and handbills of
Bish is still fresh in our memory; and
we pray devoutly that succeeding generations
may never behold a similar
spectacle.</p>

<p>It would be in vain for us, within
the limits of an article, to attempt
even the faintest sketch of the speculative
manias which, from time to
time, have affected the prosperity of
Great Britain. Some of these have
been quite, as baseless as the South
Sea bubble, and may be directly traced
to the agency and instigation of the
Stock Exchange. Others were founded
upon schemes of manifest advantage
to the public, and even to the proprietary,
if cautiously and wisely carried
out; but here again the passion
for gambling has been insanely developed,
and encouraged by those who
sought to make fortunes at the expense
of their dupes. There is at all
times, in this country, a vast deal of
unemployed capital, which, in the
cant phrase, "is waiting for investment,"
and which cannot well be invested
in any of the ordinary channels
of business. The fact is, that within
the area of Britain, it has been long
difficult for a capitalist to select a
proper field of operation; and the
tendency of recent legislation has
materially increased the difficulty. The
country, in fact, may be considered as
entirely <i>made</i>. Agricultural improvement,
on a large scale, which implied
the possession of a tract of unprofitable
country, was considered, even
before the repeal of the corn laws, as
no hopeful speculation. Since that
disastrous event, the chances have
naturally diminished; and we suspect
that, by this time, very few people
have any faith in Sir Robert Peel's proposal
for establishing new colonies in
Connaught. When we find the Whig
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_673">673</span>
Lord Monteagle denouncing free
trade as the bane of Ireland, we may
be sure that few capitalists will sink
their funds in the western bogs, hoping
that they may appear again in the
shape of golden grain which may defy
the competition of the fertile valleys
of America. We have quite enough
of factories for all the demand which
is likely to come for years: instead of
building new ones, it is always easy,
if any one has a fancy for it, to purchase
abandoned mills at a very considerable
discount; but we do not
find such stock eagerly demanded in
the market. Foreign competition has
extinguished several branches of industry
to which capital might be profitably
applied, and materially injured
others; so that moneyed men really are
at a loss for eligible investment.
This want has been felt for a long
time; and the uncertain policy of our
ministers, with regard to colonial
affairs, has undoubtedly had an injurious
effect upon the prosperity of
these dependencies. We have annihilated
much of the capital invested in
the West Indies, and have withdrawn
a great deal more. It is long since
Adam Smith urged the propriety and
the policy of identifying some of our
more important colonies with Great
Britain, by the simple process of incorporation,
thus extending materially
the field of the capitalist upon security
equal to that which he can
always command at home. Such an
opportunity is at this moment afforded
by Canada; but it seems that we will
rather run the risk of seeing Canada
merge in the United States than make
any sacrifice of our pride, even where
our interest is concerned. A considerable
deal of capital has gone to
Australia; but we suspect, from late
events, that the future supply will be
limited.</p>

<p>Before the railways opened to capitalists
a channel of investment which
appeared exceedingly plausible, and
which was, in a great measure,
guaranteed by the result of experiment,
vast masses of realised wealth
accumulated from time to time. Upon
these hoards the members, myrmidons,
and jobbers of the Stock Exchange,
cast a covetous eye: they whispered
to each other, in the language of King
John&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Let them shake the bags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hoarding abbots; angels imprisoned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set thou at liberty: the fat ribs of peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must by the hungry now be fed upon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Use our <i>commission</i> in its utmost force."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Acting upon this principle, they
made their business to find out new
channels of investment&mdash;an easier
task than the discovery of a north-western
passage in the arctic regions&mdash;and
to represent these in all the
glowing colours which are peculiar to
the artists of 'Change Alley.</p>

<p>The year 1823 was remarkable for
the commencement of an epidemic
which proved, in its effects, even more
disastrous than the South Sea delusion.
It would be tedious to enumerate or
discuss the causes which led to this
sudden outburst; some of them have
been indirectly traced to the operation
of Sir Robert Peel's famous Currency
Act of 1819, which fettered the Bank
of England, whilst it left the country
bankers free to issue unlimited paper,
and to the respite of the smaller notes
which had been previously doomed to
extinction. Whatever may have been
the cause, speculation began and increased
at a rate which was quite unprecedented.
All kinds of ridiculous
schemes found favour in the public
eye: nothing was too absurd or preposterous
to scare away applicants for
shares. Mining, building, shipping,
insurance, railway, colonising, and
washing companies were established:
even an association for the making of
gold was subscribed for to the full
amount, and doubtless a balloon company
for lunar purposes would have
been equally popular. This period
was marked by the apparition of an
entirely new animal in the precincts
of the Stock Exchange. Bulls, bears,
and even lame ducks, were creatures
coeval with its existence; but the
"stag," in its humanised form, first
appeared in 1823. The following
sketch might pass for a view of Capel
Court some two-and-twenty years
later:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The readiness with which shares were
attainable first created a class of speculators
that has ever since formed a marked
feature in periods of excitement, in the
dabblers in shares and loans with which
the courts and crannies of the parent
establishment were crowded. The scene
was worthy the pencil of an artist. With
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_674">674</span>
huge pocket-book containing worthless
scrip; with crafty countenance and cunning
eye; with showy jewellery and
threadbare coat; with well-greased locks,
and unpolished boots; with knavery in
every curl of the lip, and villany in every
thought of the heart; the stag, as he was
afterwards termed, was a prominent portrait
in the foreground. Grouped together
in one corner, might be seen a knot of
boys, eagerly buying and selling at a profit
which bore no comparison to the loss
of honesty they each day experienced.
Day after day were elderly men with
huge umbrellas witnessed in the same
spot, doing business with those whose
characters might be judged from their
company. At another point, the youth
just rising into manhood, conscious of a
few guineas in his purse, with a resolute
determination to increase them at any
price, gathered a group around, while he
delivered his invention to the listening
throng, who regarded him as a superior
spirit. In every corner, and in every
vacant space, might be seen men eagerly
discussing the premium of a new company,
the rate of a new loan, the rumoured
profit of some lucky speculator, the
rumoured failure of some great financier,
or wrangling with savage eagerness over
the fate of a shilling. The scene has been
appropriated by a novelist as not unworthy
of his pen. 'There I found myself,'
he writes, 'in such company as I
had never seen before. Gay sparks, with
their hats placed on one side, and their
hands in their breeches' pockets, walked
up and down with a magnificent strut,
whistling most harmoniously, or occasionally
humming an Italian air. Several
grave personages stood in close consultation,
scowling on all who approached, and
seeming to reprehend any intrusion. Some
lads, whose faces announced their Hebrew
origin, and whose miscellaneous finery
was finely emblematical of Rag Fair,
passed in and out; and besides these,
there attended a strangely varied rabble,
exhibiting in all sorts of forms and ages,
dirty habiliments, calamitous poverty,
and grim-visaged villany. It was curious
to me to hear with what apparent intelligence
they discussed all the concerns of
the nation. Every wretch was a statesman;
and each could explain, not only
all that had been hinted at in parliament,
but all that was at that moment
passing in the bosom of the Chancellor of
the Exchequer.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>The sketch is not over-coloured.
No one can have forgotten the sudden
swarm of flesh-flies, called from corruption
into existence during the heat
of the railway mania, and the ridiculous
airs of importance which they
assumed. A convulsion of this kind&mdash;for
it can be styled nothing else&mdash;does
infinite injury to society; for the
common greed of gain too often breaks
down the barriers which morality,
education, and refinement have reared
up, and proves that speculation, as
well as poverty, has a tendency to
make men acquainted with strange
companions.</p>

<p>There were, however, features in the
mania of 1823 which distinguish it from
every other. The joint-stock companies
established for domestic bubble purposes
engrossed but a limited share of
the public attention; though the extent
of that limitation may be estimated
by the fact, that five hundred and
thirty-two new companies were projected,
with a nominal subscribed capital of
£441,649,600. Of course only a mere
fraction of this money was actually
put down; still the gambling in the
shares was enormous. The greater
part of the capital actually abstracted
from the country went in the shape of
foreign loans, of which there were no
less than twenty-six contracted during
that disastrous period, or very shortly
before, to an amount of about fifty-six
millions. On sixteen of these loans
interest has ceased to be paid. We
find among the borrowers such states
as Chili, Buenos Ayres, Colombia,
Guatemala, Gunduljava, Mexico,
and Peru, not to mention Greece,
Portugal, and Spain, countries which
have set to Europe a scandalous example
of repudiation. Most of these
loans purported to bear interest at the
rate of six per cent, and some of them
were contracted for at so low a figure as
68; nevertheless, with all these seeming
advantages, it appears marvellous
that people should have lent their
money on such slender security as
the new republics could offer. We
observe that Mr Francis has revived
the antiquated scandal touching Joseph
Hume's "mistake" with regard
to the Greek bonds, a story which
has been a sore thorn in the side of
the veteran reformer. We think he
might have let it alone. The real
mistake lay on the part of those who
assumed that Joseph's philanthropic
interest in the Greek cause was so intense
as to suffer him for one moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_675">675</span>
to lose sight of his own. His anxiety
to back out of a bad bargain was perfectly
natural. He never was an
Epaminondas, and he felt justly irritated
at the foolishness of the Greeks
in persisting that he should sustain
the heroic character, at the expense
of his privy purse, when the stock
had fallen to a discount. If, when it
rose again to par, the Greek deputies
were weak enough to repay him the
amount of his loss, with the uttermost
farthing of interest, that was their
concern. When a senatorial sympathiser
gives the aid of his lungs to
the cause of suffering humanity, he
has surely done enough. Why mulct
him further from the pocket?</p>

<p>Those foreign loans, and the drain
of bullion which they occasioned,
speedily brought on the crisis. It
was a very fearful one, and for the
second time, at least, the Bank of England
was in danger. It was then that
mighty establishment owed its safety
to the discovery of a neglected box of
one pound notes, which, according to
the evidence of Mr Harman, one of
the principal directors, saved the credit
of the country. The coffers of the
bank were exhausted, almost to the
last sovereign; and but for that most
fortunate box, cash payments must
have been suspended in December
1825, a position of affairs the issue of
which no human intelligence could
predicate. Subsequent legislation has
not been able to guard us against the
possibility of a similar recurrence.
All that has been done is to insure
the certainty of an earlier and more
frequent panic, and to clog the wheels
of commerce by rendering discounts
impracticable at periods when no
speculation is on foot. But as far as
regards the stability of the Bank of
England, under our present monetary
laws, no provision has been made, in
any way commensurate to the additional
risk occasioned by the absorption
of the twenty millions and upwards
lodged in the savings-banks,
all which must, when required, be
repaid in the precious metals; and in
case of any convulsion, or violent
alarm, it is clear that such a demand
would be made. The experience
of 1832 has clearly demonstrated
how the fate of a ministry may be
made to depend upon the position
of the establishment in Threadneedle
Street.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not to be wondered at
that, in a commercial country like
ours, wealth should command that
respect and homage which, in other
times, was accorded to the possessors
of nobler attributes. We make every
allowance for the altered circumstances
of the age. High and heroic
valour, as it existed before, and undoubtedly
still does exist, has not the
same field for its display as in the days
when Christendom was leagued against
the Infidel, or even in those, comparatively
later, when contending factions
made their appeal to arms. Our wars,
when they do occur, are matters of
tactics and generalship; and physical
courage and daring has ceased to be
the path to more than common renown.
Where most are loyal, and no
treason is at hand, loyalty is no conspicuous
virtue. Those who are distinguished
in the walks of literature
and science need not covet adulation,
and very seldom can command it.
Their fame is of too noble and enduring
a quality to be affected by ephemeral
applause; and it is good for
them to work on in patience and in
silence, trusting for their reward hereafter.
The substantiality of wealth,
the power and patronage which it
commands, will inevitably make its
possessor more conspicuous in the
eyes of the community, than if he were
adorned with the highest mental attributes.
All things are measured by
money: and when money is acknowledged
as the chief motive power, he
who knows best how to amass it cannot
fail to be the object of attention.
But the marked and indiscriminate
homage which is paid to wealth alone,
without regard to the character of the
possessor, or the means through which
that wealth has been acquired, is, in
our estimation, a feature disgraceful
to the age, and, were it altogether
new, would justify us in thinking that
the spirit of independence had declined.
We shall hold ourselves excused from
illustrating our meaning by making
special reference to a recent but striking
instance, in which wealth suddenly
acquired, though by most iniquitous
means, raised its owner, for a time, to
the pinnacle of public observation.
We prefer selecting from the pages of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_676">676</span>
Mr Francis the portrait of a man
whose character displayed nothing
that was great, generous, benevolent,
or noble; whose whole life and whole
energies were devoted to the acquisition
of pelf; whose manners were
coarse; whose person was unprepossessing;
whose mind never ranged
beyond its own contracted and money-making
sphere; and who yet commanded,
in this England of ours, a
homage greater than was ever paid to
virtue, intellect, or valour. Such a
man was Nathan Meyer Rothschild,
the famous Jew capitalist.</p>

<p>Originally from Frankfort, this remarkable
man came over to England
towards the close of last century, and
commenced operations in Manchester,
where he is said to have speedily
trebled his first capital of £20,000:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This," says Mr Francis, "was the
foundation of that colossal fortune which
afterwards passed into a proverb; and in
1800, finding Manchester too small for
the mind which could grapple with these
profits, Rothschild came to London. It
was the period when such a man was
sure to make progress, as, clear and comprehensive
in his commercial views, he
was also rapid and decisive in working
out the ideas which presented themselves.
Business was plentiful; the entire Continent
formed our customers; and Rothschild
reaped a rich reward. From bargain
to bargain, from profit to profit, the
Hebrew financier went on and prospered.
Gifted with a fine perception, he never
hesitated in action. Having bought some
bills of the Duke of Wellington at a discount&mdash;to
the payment of which the faith
of the state was pledged&mdash;his next operation
was to buy the gold which was
necessary to pay them, and, when he had
purchased it, he was, as he expected, informed
that the government required it.
Government had it&mdash;but, doubtless, paid
for the accommodation. 'It was the best
business I ever did!' he exclaimed triumphantly;
and he added that, when the
government had got it, it was of no service
to them until he had undertaken to
convey it to Portugal."</p></blockquote>

<p>Rothschild was, in fact, a usurer to
the state, as greedy and unconscionable
as the humbler Hebrew who
discounts the bill of a spendthrift at
forty per cent, and, instead of handing
over the balance in cash to his
victim, forces him to accept the moiety
in coals, pictures, or cigars. His
information was minute, exclusive,
and ramified. All the arts which had
been employed on the Stock Exchange
in earlier times were revived
by him, and new "dodges" introduced
to depress or to raise the market.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"One cause of his success was the
secrecy with which he shrouded all his
transactions, and the tortuous policy with
which he misled those the most who
watched him the keenest. If he possessed
news calculated to make the funds
rise, he would commission the broker who
acted on his behalf to sell half a million.
The shoal of men who usually follow the
movements of others sold with him. The
news soon passed through Capel Court
that Rothschild was bearing the market,
and the funds fell. Men looked doubtingly
at one another; a general panic
spread; bad news was looked for; and
these united agencies sank the price two
or three per cent. This was the result
expected; and other brokers, not usually
employed by him, bought all they could
at the reduced rate. By the time this
was accomplished, the good news had arrived;
the pressure ceased; the funds
rose instantly; and Mr Rothschild reaped
his reward."</p></blockquote>

<p>The morality of the ring has sometimes
been called in question; but we
freely confess, that we would rather
trust ourselves implicitly to the tender
mercies of the veriest leg that
ever bartered horse-flesh, than to
those of such a man as "the first
baron of Jewry"&mdash;a title which was
given him by a foreign potentate, to
the profanation of a noble Christian
order.</p>

<p>Such were the doings of Rothschild:
let us now see him in person. "He
was a mark for the satirists of the day.
His huge and somewhat slovenly appearance;
the lounging attitude he assumed,
as he leaned against his pillar
in the Royal Exchange; his rough and
rugged speech; his foreign accent and
idiom, made caricature mark him as
its own; while even caricature lost
all power over a subject which defied
its utmost skill. His person was made
an object of ridicule; but his form
and features were from God. His
mind and manners were fashioned by
circumstances; his acts alone were
public property, and by these we have
a right to judge him. No great benevolence
lit up his path; no great charity
is related of him. The press, ever
ready to chronicle liberal deeds, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_677">677</span>
almost silent upon the point; and the
fine feeling which marked the path of
an Abraham Goldsmid, and which
brightens the career of many of the
same creed, is unrecorded by the
power which alone could give it publicity."</p>

<p>Mr Disraeli, in some of his clever
novels, has drawn the portrait of a
great Jew financier in colours at once
brilliant and pleasing. His Sidonia,
whilst deeply engaged in money-making
pursuits, is represented as a man
of boundless accomplishment, expanded
intellect, varied information,
and princely generosity. He is the
very Paladin of the Exchange&mdash;a
compound of Orlando and Sir Moses
Montefiore. The extravagance of the
conception does not prevent us from
admiring the consummate skill of the
author, in adapting his materials so as
to elevate our ideas and estimate of
the Hebrew idiosyncrasy. Sidonia is
as much at home in the palace as in
the counting-room; his great wealth
ceases to be the prominent feature,
and becomes the mere accessory of the
polished and intellectual man; avarice
never for one moment is permitted to
appear; on the contrary, the prodigality
of the munificent Hebrew is
something more than Oriental. We
may refuse to believe in the reality of
such a character, which implies a combination
of the most antagonistic pursuits,
and a union of mental attributes
which could not possibly coexist; but,
this difficulty once surmounted, we
cannot challenge the right of so eminently
gifted an individual to take his
place among the true nobility of the
earth. We fear, however, that such
a ph&oelig;nix of Palestine has no existence,
save on paper. Certain it is,
that Rothschild was not the man;
and yet Rothschild, in his day, commanded
as much homage as the novelist
has claimed for Sidonia. Great is
the power of money! Princes feasted
with him; ambassadors attended him
to the tomb; and yet, for all we can
learn, he was not equal, in moral
worth, to the meanest pauper in the
workhouse. He would at times give
a guinea to a street beggar, not for
the object of relieving his wants, but
to enjoy the joke of seeing him run
away, under the apprehension that
the donor had been mistaken in the
coin! His wealth was gained by
chicanery, and augmented by systematic
deceit; and yet attend to the
words of the chronicler:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Peers and princes of the blood sat at
his table; clergymen and laymen bowed
before him; and they who preached loudest
against mammon, bent lowest before
the mammon-worshipper. Gorgeous plate,
fine furniture, an establishment such as
many a noble of Norman descent would
envy, graced his entertainments. Without
social refinement, with manners which,
offensive in the million, were but <i>brusque</i>
in the millionnaire; he collected around
him the fastidious members of the most
fastidious aristocracy in the world. He
saw the representatives of all the states
in Europe proud of his friendship. By
the democratic envoy of the New World,
by the ambassador of the imperial Russ,
was his hospitality alike accepted; while
the man who warred with slavery in all
its forms and phases, was himself slave to
the golden reputation of the Hebrew.
The language which Mr Rothschild could
use when his anger overbalanced his discretion,
was a license allowed to his
wealth; and he who, when placed in a
position which almost compelled him to
subscribe to a pressing charity, could exclaim,
"Here, write a cheque&mdash;I have
made one&mdash;fool of myself!" was courted
and caressed by the clergy, was fêted and
followed by the peer, was treated as an
equal by the first minister of the crown,
and more than worshipped by those whose
names stood foremost on the roll of a commercial
aristocracy. His mode of dictating
letters was characteristic of a mind
entirely absorbed in money-making; and
his ravings, when he found a bill unexpectedly
protested, were translated into
mercantile language before they were fit
to meet a correspondent's eye. It is painful
to write thus depreciatingly of a man
who possessed so large a development of
brain; but the golden gods of England
have many idolaters, and the voice of
truth rarely penetrates the private room
of the English merchant."</p></blockquote>

<p>Poor as Lazarus may be, let him not
envy the position of Dives. Even in
this world, riches cannot purchase happiness.
Any pecuniary loss was enough
to drive Rothschild to despair. His
existence was further embittered by
the dread of assassination&mdash;no uncommon
symptom, when the mind is rarely
at ease; and those who knew him
best, said that he was often troubled
with such thoughts, and that they
haunted him at moments when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_678">678</span>
would willingly have forgotten them.
"Happy!" he said, in reply to the
compliment of a guest&mdash;"me happy!
what! happy when, just as you are
going to dine, you have a letter placed
in your hands, saying, 'If you do not
send me £500, I will blow your brains
out?' Happy!&mdash;me happy!" We are
not compassionate enough to wish that
it had been otherwise. Such thoughts
are the foreshadowing of the end of
those who have prospered beyond their
deserts, and have failed in making
even that negative expiation, which
conscience sometimes extorts from the
apprehensions of unscrupulous men.</p>

<p>And here we shall close our remarks.
There is still a fertile field
before us, on which we might be
tempted to enter; but that discussion
would bring us too near our own days,
and involve the resumption of topics
which have already been handled in
Maga. The time doubtless will come,
when, after the cessation of some new
fit of speculation, and when men are
cursing their folly, and attempting by
late industry to repair their shattered
fortunes, some historian like Mr Francis
shall take up the pen, and chronicle
our weakness, as that of our fathers
is already chronicled. In the meantime,
it would be well for all of us
seriously to lay to heart the lesson
which may be drawn from this interesting
record. Speculation, carried
beyond due bounds, is neither more
nor less than a repetition of the old
game of <span class="smcap">Beggar my Neighbour</span>,
under another form. To fair and
legitimate enterprise we owe much of
our modern improvement; which has
been further rendered necessary by
the pressure which has increased, and
is increasing upon us. To unfair and
illegitimate enterprise, undertaken for
the sole purpose of immediate gain,
we owe nothing save periods of great
misery and desolation. The game of
<span class="smcap">Beggar my Neighbour</span> may be
played privately or publicly. Some
of us have taken a hand in it privately,
with what results we shall keep to
ourselves. For several years back,
our statesmen have played the public
game, and played it well. They have
succeeded in inflicting successively a
blow upon each great interest of the
country, by dealing with each separately,
and by alienating the sympathy
of the others. The game is now
pretty well played out; and when we
come to reckon our counters, it is
evident from the result, that not one
of the parties so dealt with has been
a winner! Who, then, are the gainers?
We think the answer is plain. They
are the Capitalist and the Foreigner.</p>

<small>BY AN OLD PENINSULAR.<br />

PART II.</small></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>We held our course, after parting
with our friends in the boat, and
were soon at the harbour's mouth.
The breeze continued to freshen, and
the swell to increase. Our little
Wilhelmina now began to give us a
specimen of her qualities as a sea-boat.
Labouring through the curled
and crested seas, creaking, groaning,
vibrating from stem to stern; now
balancing, with her keel half bare, on
the summit of a lofty surge, now deep
in a liquid trough; now kicking up
behind, now running her nose bang
into a bank of water; now pointing
skywards, as if bound to the moon,
and not to Lisbon; now pitching, now
jig-jigging it, she simulated the paces
of a Spanish genet&mdash;a great deal of
action, very little progress.</p>

<p>By the time we were clear of the
harbour, and in comparatively smooth
water, the wind had shifted to the
north-west; our course lay south,
and, being sheltered by the land, we
soon exchanged the jig-jigging of our
exit from port for a far more agreeable,
because more equable motion,
as we drove over ocean's swell. It
had already become palpably evident
that none of our military friends were
good sailors. Now, however, they
were all able to stand without holding&mdash;all,
I should say, but one unhappy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_679">679</span>
individual, and that was Mr
Commissary Capsicum, who had been
reduced to a miserable state of disorder
by the active movements of the
brig, and whose actual symptoms
were by no means those of convalescence.</p>

<p>Night closed in. It was past twilight,
yet not wholly dark&mdash;in short, that interval
between twilight and perfect
night, for which in English we have no
word, but which the richer language of
Burns expressively designates as "the
gloaming." Little more than enough
of it to fill the sails and give the vessel
way, the wind was soft, and at times
scarcely perceptible. The waves heaved
lazily; the ship surmounted them
with measured rise and fall; and,
though the heavens were overcast, a
light, different from that of day, clear
but faint, was equably diffused on all
sides. The tremulous surface of the
ocean, dark, but distinguishable to the
horizon, was there sharply outlined
against the pale but still luminous
sky.</p>

<p>Since we left port in the morning,
what with showers and spray, wind
and sunshine, I had been more than
once wet through and dry again. The
consequences were now perceptible.
I shivered inwardly. My mind, too,
was ill at ease. After much reflection,
and some self-examination, I
came to this conclusion: that something
was requisite, something was indispensable,
in my actual condition both
of mind and body. What that something
was, did not instantly occur to
me. I asked myself the question
point-blank&mdash;I answered it. The
problem was solved: I wanted&mdash;a
nightcap. Down I rushed into the
cabin. "Steward, bring me some hot
water and a little brandy."&mdash;"Yes,
sir; a glass of hot brandy and water,
sir; coming directly, sir."&mdash;"No, no,
steward; that's not what I called for.
Bring the brandy and the hot water
separate. I'll mix for myself."</p>

<p>"Quite right," growled a feeble
voice. It was poor, unhappy, still-very-far-from-perfectly-recovered
Mr
Capsicum's. The falling of the wind
had so far abated the ship's movements,
that his worst symptoms were
now relieved. Still, however, he was
far, very far, from well. Most of the
passengers had turned in; but there,
by lamplight, sat poor Capsicum at
the cabin table, from sheer listlessness,
destitute of sufficient energies to
put himself to bed, a lamentable spectacle.</p>

<p>"Suppose you join me, then," said
I. "Do you good."</p>

<p>"Can't, can't," said he, plaintively.
"Couldn't get it down, if I knew it
would make me well this instant.
Wish I could. I'll see you take
yours, though. That'll be some comfort,
anyhow."</p>

<p>The steward now brought hot
water, half a lemon, lump-sugar,
tumbler half full of capital brandy.&mdash;"Here,
steward, you may take the
lemon away with you. Don't want
it."</p>

<p>"Quite right," grunted Capsicum,
who thought himself a connoisseur in
all things eatable and drinkable.
"Quite right; no rum, no lemon."
Spite of his pitiful plight, he now,
<i>con amore</i>, set himself to watch my
operations critically; as if, from the
brewing, he would form an estimate of
my judgment, capabilities, taste, character,
and general attainments.</p>

<p>With the silver tongs I extracted a
lump of crystal sugar, the largest in
the basin. The present "without"
system was not then in vogue, nor
have I adopted it yet. But now there
was a hitch&mdash;how to melt the sugar.
In the tumbler it must not go&mdash;there
was the brandy: that had been an infringement
of all the laws of potatory
combination. I felt that I was under
observation, and that my character
was at stake. I placed the sugar in
the spoon. "Quite right," said Capsicum.</p>

<p>Yet neither, according to the modern
practice, did I wash the sugar,
half melted, from the spoon into the
tumbler, with a stream of hot water.
That, I submit, is an approximation
to the error of immersing the sugar in
the unmixed brandy. No, no. Holding
the spoon over the tumbler, I
carefully dropped upon the sugar three
drops of the boiling water. It was
enough. The sugar gradually subsided
into a pellucid liquid, which filled
the spoon. Capsicum, who, sick as
he was, still watched my proceedings
with the deepest interest, and with a
patronising air of mild benignity, repeated
his testimonial&mdash;"Quite right."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_680">680</span></p>

<p>Waiting till the sugar was wholly
dissolved, I then at length infused
sufficient hot water to scald the raw
spirits, then added the sugar. Two
or three stirs sufficed; not a bead
floated on the surface. The mixture
was made&mdash;tumbler about half an inch
from full&mdash;a "stiff un." Capsicum
raised himself from the table on which
he had been leaning, with folded arms,
like a cat watching a mouse, and gave
a snort of approbation.</p>

<p>"You and that white fellow old acquaintance?"
said Capsicum.</p>

<p>"Our acquaintance," replied I,
"commenced at Falmouth about a
week ago."</p>

<p>"Oh! thought perhaps he was some
family connexion," said Capsicum.</p>

<p>"The connexion is quite recent, as
I tell you," said I; "but I certainly
don't mean to cut it. Hope to dine
with him at headquarters, every day
I'm disengaged."</p>

<p>"Dine with him at headquarters?"
replied Capsicum. "You'll do nothing
of the kind, I can tell you that, sir.
That is, you'll dine with him at my
table; pretty often, too, I trust. Hope
I shall frequently have the pleasure of
seeing you both. But at his own
table, if you're twenty years at headquarters,
you won't dine with him
once; take my word for that. John
Barrymore wouldn't suffer it." Here
was a blow!</p>

<p>"Well, but that's a thing I can't
understand," said I.</p>

<p>"Well then, I must make you understand
it," replied Capsicum. "You
are going out on an appointment as
clerk in John Barrymore's Department.
Isn't it so?" I bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Very well. That white chap does
business in commissariat bills. When
he gets a bill, he's dying to get the
cash. Your Department pays the
cash. Don't you see, my dear sir?
It wouldn't do. It would be utterly
at variance with all the rules of propriety,
for any man in your Department
to be on terms of intimacy with
any man who does business in bills.
Besides, it would be contrary to headquarters
etiquette; everybody would
talk about it. Now," added Capsicum,
with a self-approving air, "now
I've done my duty by John Barrymore.
Noticed you were very thick.
Thought I'd tell you, the first opportunity.
Oh me! oh me!" (sighing,
panting, gasping, pressing his hands
on his stomach, and swaying his head
from side to side,) "how very ill I do,
feel! Such a horrid sensation! a don't-know-howishness&mdash;a
sort of a come-overishness!
The exertion of talking
has made me quite bad again. Here,
steward! steward! I must go on
deck this instant." He turned ghastly
green.</p>

<p>"Yet," said I, hoping he would
soon be better, "Mr Gingham, it
seems, can dine with <i>you</i>, without any
breach of propriety."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, to be sure he can,"
said Capsicum; "and so can you.
Our Department don't finger the cash.
Don't you see? That makes all the
difference. Hope you'll both dine
with me often."</p>

<p>"Shall be very happy," replied I:
"much obliged for your kind invitation.
But still I can't understand.
Mr Gingham has been at headquarters
before, and knows headquarters. He
also knows, I suppose, that your
humble servant is a clerk of the military
chest. Yet it was he himself
who made the proposal that he and I
should campaign together."</p>

<p>"Can't explain that," said Capsicum;
"must leave him to explain
that as he can. Oh! here he comes."</p>

<p>Gingham, before he turned in, had
been on deck, to take a last look at the
weather, to commune with the silent
night, to scrutinise the horizon, to soliloquise
with the clouds, and perhaps
for some better and more solemn purposes:
for Gingham, with all his oddities,
was a man of religious principle,
and of devotional feeling, and cared
not who knew it. He now approached,
and seated himself with us at the
cabin table.</p>

<p>"Saw you at Cadiz," said Capsicum.
"Think I saw you at Madrid."</p>

<p>"I saw you at Canton," coolly replied
Gingham. Capsicum looked a
little queer.</p>

<p>"At Canton?" said Capsicum.
"Saw me at Canton? Did you,
though? Come, come, now you're
joking, you know. Did you though,
really? How was I dressed?"</p>

<p>"You were dressed like what you
were; not exactly as you are dressed
now. You had a long, taper pigtail,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_681">681</span>
reaching down to your heels; no hair
on your head besides. You had slippers,
scarlet and gold, turned up at
the toes. You carried a fan; and
didn't I once or twice see you followed
by a fellow who carried a parasol over
your head at the top of a long pole?
You had&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what," said Capsicum
precipitately; "I'm a Christian for
all that, and my father was an Englishman.
True, I was bred at Canton;
but I wasn't born there. Born
at Macao. My mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here, in a voice which ran through
all the notes of the gamut, not however
in due order, but like the cat's
minuet, high and low alternately,
Gingham struck up a strange outlandish
sort of utterance, whether
talking or singing I could not tell;
but, if singing, it was the rummest
song I ever heard&mdash;a jumping, dissonant
compound of bass and treble.
Capsicum responded in a similar
fugue. The two funny rogues were
speaking Chinese! The discovery of
Capsicum's semi-gentile extraction
tickled my fancy not a little.</p>

<p>"So," said Capsicum to Gingham,
"you and Johnny intend to make a
joint concern of it at headquarters."</p>

<p>"That's how we've settled it," replied
Gingham.</p>

<p>"Can't be," said Capsicum.
"Thought you knew all headquarters'
rules, regulations, and observances."</p>

<p>"Thought I did know something
about them," replied Gingham.</p>

<p>"Well, then," replied Capsicum,
"don't you know what department
young Johnny here belongs to?"</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> department, the commissariat
department, I always understood,"
replied Gingham; "saw his
name put down so in the list of passengers
per packet at Falmouth. If
Mr Y&mdash; will oblige me by referring to
a document, which I had the honour
of handing him before dinner, he will
find himself there designated accordingly."</p>

<p>Sure enough, so it was: "G. Y&mdash;,
Esq., Commissary-General's Department,
in A. C., with Gingham Gingham."</p>

<p>"But didn't you happen to know
that Mr Y&mdash;, as you call him," said
Capsicum, "was John Barrymore's
own nephew?"</p>

<p>"Of that circumstance I was not
cognisant," replied Gingham, "till I
happened to become aware of it by
the conversation during dinner. Still
I retained my former impression, that
Mr Y&mdash; belonged to your department,
not to the military chest."</p>

<p>"The long and the short of it,"
said I to Gingham, "is this. Shirty
here, I am sorry to say, gives me to
understand that, at headquarters, as I
am attached to the military chest, and
not to the commissariat, I cannot have
the pleasure of stretching my legs
under your table, when you give a
spread. My regret is undissembled
and profound."</p>

<p>"Nor," said Gingham, "while we
both retain our present positions, can
we be more than common acquaintance."</p>

<p>The shock of this <i>dénouement</i> was
diverted by Capsicum. Spite of his
sea-sickness he had purpled up; his
eyes flashed and twinkled beneath his
massive and contracted brows; he
growled, he grunted, he wheezed, he
snorted, he puffed; for a time he could
not articulate. Either he performed
admirably, or he was regularly riled.
At length, recovering his breath, not
once looking at me, but leaning over
to Gingham on the table, he whispered
hurriedly, "What does he mean
by that? Shirty? Who's Shirty?"
Again he turned very green, and sat
back in his chair, panting, and swaying
his head, like a man ready to
faint.</p>

<p>I was sorry to see him so ill, and
begged to apologise. He with the
greatest propriety might call me
"Johnny Newcome," yet it ill became
me to call him "Shirty." The name
was casually suggested by his profusion
of frill, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Mr Johnny,"
said Capsicum, "it's well for you I'm
so bad as I am: wish I was better,
for your sake. Wouldn't I pitch into
you at once, and give you a precious
good hiding? Oh dear! oh me! I am
so very bad!" Then, rallying again:
"Ah, I wish you did belong to my
department! Wouldn't I detach you
on outpost duty? Wouldn't I make
you ride till you had no leather left?
Wouldn't I send you bullock-hunting
over the sierras? Oh, dreadful!
dreadful! What a horrid sensation this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_682">682</span>
sea-sickness is! Well, good night. I
suppose I shall be called Shirty as
long as I live." He tottled off to his
berth.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may say that," said
Joey, from behind his curtain. Joey
was right. Ten years after, I heard
an old Peninsular speak of Capsicum
by the name of Shirty.</p>

<p>There is certainly something very
adhesive in a sobriquet; that is, if it
happens to stick when first applied.
A lubberly big boy once gave me a
thrashing at school; and I gave him
the only redress in my power, as
we were not allowed to throw stones&mdash;the
name of "Buttons." He had
cheated me at the game; and he had
many on his jacket. "Buttons" was
his name, to his dying day.</p>

<p>Gingham and I remained at the
table. "Mr Capsicum is quite
right," said Gingham. "Very proper
it should be so. Not the less
sorry on that account. At Lisbon,
you will, in fact, have joined. From
the time we land, then, our communications
must be limited to the ordinary
civilities of social life: until," he
added, with a confidential look,
"having digested my grand financial
project, with Lisbon as the basis of
my operations, I am prepared to promulgate
it, as authorised, at the
headquarters of the British army.
Then," said he, proudly, "I shall
take such an entirely different footing,
so high above the vulgar imputations
which always attach to a
dealer in bills, that, without exposing
either you or myself to criticism, I
may again permit myself the pleasure
of cultivating your acquaintance, on
our present terms of friendship&mdash;I
may say, intimacy. At any rate,
while we remain on board the packet,
that intimacy, I trust, will experience
no diminution. Good night, sir."</p>

<p>We shook hands: his manner, I
thought, a little stiff.</p>

<p>Left alone in the cabin, leaning on
the table, the night-lamp shedding a
dim and dubious light, my small
modicum of brandy-and-water expended,
and the time gone by for
brewing another, as the steward had
turned in, I sat and ruminated.
Gingham, watching his opportunity,
had benevolently endeavoured to
make me sensible, that, as a clerk on
actual service, I should soon be engaged
in duties which could not be
performed to my own credit, without
care and circumspection; and that I
might find myself, ere long, in some
responsible situation, demanding the
utmost caution and energy, to compensate
my inexperience. Since the morning,
for we had been much together during
the day, through his friendly suggestions,
I had, in a measure, become
conscious of all this: I was beginning
to feel the value of such a monitor;
and now, it appeared, he was lost to
me in that character! Then there
were other considerations of a deeper
kind. I remembered the dinner at
the hotel; I remembered the breakfast;
I thought of the travelling
store-closet. To have lost such a
companion of my first campaign&mdash;it
was, indeed, a loss! Had I never
dined with him, I could have better
borne it!</p>

<p>At length I came to this conclusion;
that, as all the other passengers
had retired to rest, I&mdash;had better
do the same. I was about to put my
decision in execution, when my attention
was arrested by a lamentable
cry, which issued from the berth of
poor Mr Commissary Capsicum. "I
can't&mdash;I can't&mdash;I'm stuck!&mdash;weak as
a rat! Oh, I am so very bad! Here,
steward! steward!&mdash;ah! oh!" Having
heard his monody to the end, and
waited in vain for a second stave, I
flew to his assistance.</p>

<p>Poor Mr Commissary Capsicum
had contrived to divest himself of his
diurnal habiliments; and was now
embellished with a red <i>bonnet de nuit</i>;
and an elegant night-shirt, which fitted&mdash;as
if it had been made for him.
I found him&mdash;in what an attitude!
One leg he had contrived to hoist
into his berth. <i>Quoad</i> that leg, he
was kneeling on the mattress. The
other leg was stretched towards the
floor, which he barely touched with
his extended and agonised toe. In
this painful position, he was clawing
with both hands at the board intended
to keep him in bed, equally
unable to advance and to recede.
Something&mdash;either the wooden tester&mdash;or
the proximity of his shake-down
to the deck above&mdash;or what else, I
cannot pretend to say&mdash;prevented his
further movements. He wanted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_683">683</span>
strength; there he was, literally, as
he expressed it, stuck. I expressed
the deepest sympathy.</p>

<p>Joey whipped on his drawers and
dressing-gown, and was with us in a
twinkling. Joey, seeing all other
expedients vain, brought his shoulder
to bear, and commenced a series of
well-directed <i>hoists</i>, each hoist accompanied
with a musical "Yeo-heave-ho."
I laughed; Joey laughed; poor
Capsicum himself caught the infection:
his whining and whimpering
gradually glided into a deep pectoral
chuckle. The object was at length
effected. Capsicum was stowed for
the night; but not without vigorous
and long-continued efforts, both on
Joey's part and mine. "Can't imagine
what caused the obstruction,"
said I; "it's prodigious; it's incredible."
"Incredible, but true," replied
Joey; "suppose we call it 'A
tail founded on facts.'" "Good
night. Good night, Mr Capsicum."
"Good night, Mr Capsicum; good
night." "Good night; ah! oh!
what <i>shall</i> I do? Suppose I should
be taken bad again before morning!
Thank you both. Goodnight. Two
impudent, unfeeling young hounds.
Good night."</p>

<p>So terminated our first day afloat.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>It has been intelligently remarked,
that, in writing travels by land or by
sea, the traveller has only to jot down
everything just as it occurs, and he
will be sure to produce a book worth
reading. This rule may be excellent
in theory; but, gentle reader, it will
not do. Only look here. I have not
jotted down one tithe of the incidents
of the first ten hours since we left harbour;
and see what a long yarn it
makes. A man who, in travelling,
really registered everything, would
yarn away at the rate of a quarto a
week.</p>

<p>There <i>is</i>, however, an observation
which is much more to the purpose;
namely, that one day at sea is very
like another. This we certainly
found out, in our voyage from Falmouth
to Lisbon. For, with the
exception of changes in wind and
weather, little occurred to vary our
daily existence; at least till we got
off Oporto, and took in fresh passengers.
During the first night after we
left Falmouth, the wind got round to
the S.W. We had three days of it,
regular Channel weather: thick,
cloudy, squally&mdash;much rain&mdash;the ship
pitching, labouring, creaking, straining,
groaning&mdash;going every way but
the way we wanted to go&mdash;all the
passengers, except Joey, more or less
indisposed&mdash;and nobody pleased but
the skipper, who whistled a perpetual
"Yankee doodle" rondo, and seemed
to exult in our miseries. "I calculate,"
said Joey, "if this lasts much
longer, we shall come to anchor in the
Downs." For want of anything to
relate, and for the benefit of the
reader, should he cross "the Bay," I
shall here beg leave to say a few
words respecting that horrid malady
to which landsmen are subject on
board ship, and respecting my own
mode of dealing with it. <i>Experto
crede.</i></p>

<p>My case resembles that of many
other persons; <i>i.e.</i>, in foul weather
on board ship, you do not, we will
say, at once get thoroughly ill; but
certain disagreeable sensations, quite
sufficient to call a man's attention to
himself, such as giddiness, prostration
of strength, awful depression of the
whole system, and still more awful
sensations at the pit of the stomach,
induce the painful consciousness that
you are very, very far from well, and
in some danger of being worse before
you are better. In this state of the
case, the "indication," as the doctors
say, is to keep off daddy Neptune's
last outrage, the detested crisis.
Don't give ear to the good-natured
friend who says, "You had better be
ill at once, and get it over." That
may do very well in a sail from West
Cowes to Allum Bay; but it won't
answer if you are a fortnight at sea.
You may be "ill at once," if you
please; but don't be certain "you'll
get it over;" if once you begin, you
may go on for a week. Keep well,
then, if you can.</p>

<p>Now, as long as you can keep your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_684">684</span>
legs, and keep on deck, you can generally
effect this. In your berth, also,
in a recumbent posture, you may
manage to escape the dire catastrophe.
The real difficulty is this:
that, in passing from one of these
states to the other, <i>e.g.</i>, in turning in
at night, or turning out in the morning,
in all human probability you become
a miserable victim. You must
dress&mdash;you must undress&mdash;and, in the
course of doffing or donning, ten to
one your worst apprehensions become
a reality. What, then, is the remedy?
Now, don't stare, but be advised.
Till you are fairly seasoned, which
you probably will be in three or four
days if you do as I tell you, don't doff
or don at all. Keep on deck all day,
get thoroughly cold, tired, and drowsy,
rush below at night, throw yourself
on your mattress as you are, go to
sleep at once. In the morning, the
moment you turn out, rush on deck.
No shaving; no titivating. You
must wash, must you? Go forwards,
then; wash in the open air; wash
anywhere but below. "Beastly,
though, to go day after day without
a change." Beastly, I admit; but
not so beastly as day after day of
convulsive paroxysms and horrid
heavings; and, depend upon it, if
once you begin, there is no telling
how long it may last. Whereas follow
my plan, and in three or four
days you are all right&mdash;you are seasoned&mdash;the
ship may dance a polka,
and you not the worse for it. You
may then go below, and stay below,
with perfect impunity&mdash;treat yourself
to a grand universal scrub and a clean
shirt&mdash;and, if you are a shaver, shave&mdash;only
remember you are shaving on
board ship, and mind you don't cut
off your nose. After all, it's a matter
of taste, I admit: and tastes are
various. If you consider a three-days'
shirt, and a rough chin, greater evils
than vomitory agonies, and spasms
of the diaphragm, why, do as you
like; shave, titivate, change, your
linen, and retch your heart up.</p>

<p>During the three days of foul
weather, wind S.W., I contrived to
keep about, by following the method
indicated above. On the fourth, the
wind returned to the N.W., with an
occasional brash of rain; and we
were again able to hold our course.
I was then myself again, past the
power of sea-sickness; and could walk
the deck with Joey, cast accounts
with Gingham, sit out the dinner
without declining soup, respectfully
ogle the lovely Juno, and occasionally
extort a giggle. On the morning of
this same day, impelled by curiosity,
I approached the berth where lay deposited
the unhappy Capsicum, and
drew his curtain. Ah! is that Capsicum?
Alas, how changed! He
looked like death. I spoke to him.
His lips moved, but his voice was inaudible.
I felt his pulse. It was
scarcely perceptible. He was in a
state of collapse!</p>

<p>Deeming the exigency cogent, I
fetched Mr Staff-surgeon Pledget.
Pledget, after due examination, pronounced
it a serious case, prescribed
a restorative, departed to compound,
and soon came back with it&mdash;only
about half a pint. With some difficulty,
poor Capsicum was got up in
his berth, and the restorative was got
down. Anticipating recalcitration,
Pledget had come provided with a
small <i>horn</i>. Having swallowed the
dose, Capsicum found his voice.
"Ah me!" he feebly whined, with a
look of inexpressible horror and disgust,
and his hand pressed upon the
pit of his stomach; "ah me! is it an
aperient?" Then, in a low and indignant
growl, "Never took physic before,
in all my life." He lay back on
his bolster, with closed eyes, in feeble
and sulky silence. Pledget withdrew,
and I remained.</p>

<p>Presently, reopening his eyes, he
cautiously looked around. "Is that
fellow gone?" he whispered. I nodded.
"Look in the cabin," he whispered
again.</p>

<p>"Gone on deck," said I; "not
quite right yet, himself. Do you want
him? Shall I call him back?"</p>

<p>"No, no; nonsense! I say, you
mix me a glass of <i>that</i>&mdash;you know
what&mdash;the same you took yourself
t'other night."</p>

<p>I hesitated. There was no doubt
in the world it would do him a deal
of good. But then he was under
treatment; he was <i>medically</i> ill.
What was I to do?</p>

<p>He looked at me appealingly,
coaxingly, touchingly. "I'd do as
much for you," said he.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_685">685</span></p>

<p>There was no standing that. I
clancularly gave my orders to the
steward. The steward grinned, and
brought the materials. In due time
the mixture was made; and, in a very
short time after, the patient had stowed
it away. "I shall get up," said he.
"Just help me out." I sent the
steward to request the aid of Joey.</p>

<p>By unshipping the board at the side,
we got Capsicum out of his crib, far
more easily than we had got him in.
But, alas, his legs doubled under him;
he was helpless as an infant, and almost
fainted away. At length we
managed to dress him; and seated
him in full fig at the cabin table, with
his enormous snuff-box open before
him. At dinner, that day, he managed
the wing of a chicken and a slice of
tongue. Couldn't a currant dumpling,
though&mdash;was set against it by the
wine sauce. Pledget had the credit
of the cure.</p>

<p>I omit to relate, <i>in extenso</i>, how we
were chased by what we took for an
American sloop of war, but what
proved to be an English frigate; how
the arm-chest was got upon deck when
we expected to be brought to action;
and how the muskets were found, like
poor Capsicum, stuck&mdash;rusted together
into a mass, for want of looking
after; how badly the said frigate
threw her shot, sending the first,
which ought to have gone ahead of us,
slap through our topsail, and the second,
which should have been a more
direct communication, half a quarter
of a mile wide; how the Major
and Captain Gabion saw the said shot
as they were coming, while I saw
nothing but the splash in the water;
how our leisure hours were solaced by
two combative drakes, shut up together
in the same coop, which fought
incessantly, day and night, from the
beginning to the end of the voyage&mdash;if
you held a lantern to them in the
dark, they were still fighting; how,
when one hen laid an egg, the others
pecked at it, and gobbled it up; how
the skipper was rude to everybody
on board&mdash;to the Major, it appeared,
grossly so. These particulars, with
many others, I defer to my quarto
edition.</p>

<p>Yet let me not omit the skipper's
confidence to Joey; how <i>he</i> thought
passengers should be victualled on
board ship. "Fust, good flabby pea-soup,
as thick as batter&mdash;plenty on it&mdash;let
'em blow out their jeckits with
that. When it's took away, why, then
perpose a glass of bottled porter all
round. Fust dinner aboard; won't it
make some on 'em bolt?"</p>

<p>Perhaps, my dear madam, the best
way of giving you a general idea of
our voyage, will be to present you
with a description of our mode of life
from day to day. The rule with our
military friends was, to take fun out
of everything; and they proved themselves
perfect adepts in all the means
and methods, thereto available;
hoaxing, quizzing, shaving, imitating,
trotting, cajoling, bamboozling. Pledget
could not make it out&mdash;wondered
what it all meant; and one day
gravely asked me, if I could explain
the nature and cause of laughter.
Laughter he viewed as a psychological
problem; we had plenty on board;
but he could not solve it. The best
thing was, that Pledget himself
caught the infection at last, and began
to laugh. It was curious to
watch the first stirrings of nascent
humour in Pledget's mind. Towards
the close of the voyage he had actually,
though by slow degrees, concocted
a joke; and, had our passage
been to the West Indies, and not to
Lisbon, he would perhaps have got
so far as to try it on. The victim of
the said joke was to be Capsicum.
Capsicum's birth at Macao, and breeding
at Canton, had transpired through
Joey. Pledget's primary idea was,
that Capsicum might possibly have a
penchant for a dish of stewed puppies.
This bold, ingenious, and comical
conception, as he fed on it from hour
to hour, and from day to day, in
about three days' time began to grow
in his mind; and, as it grew, it ramified.
From one thing to another, at
length it came to this: that, with my
co-operation, Joey's, and the steward's,
Capsicum was to be persuaded
that a batch of puppies had actually
been littered on board. Capsicum,
kept momentarily cognisant of the
progress of Pledget's plot, by the
treachery of those to whom it was
confided, was prepared to humour the
joke, whenever Pledget commenced
operations. Pledget, big with his
own idea, walked the deck for hours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_686">686</span>
together, rubbing his hands in an
ecstasy, and laughing till he whimpered.
When Joey or I took a turn,
he was soon by our side, screeching
in a rapidly ascending gamut, with
pungent delight, and much cachinnation,
"Puppies! puppies! Oh, sir,
won't they be nice? Poor old Capsicum!&mdash;puppies!
puppies!"</p>

<p>The day before we made the coast
of Spain, I was fairly "trotted."
You must know, I fancied in those
days I could sing. Item, my dear
father had brought home, from the
Peninsula, some very pretty Portuguese
airs, of the kind called modinhas&mdash;which
modinhas I had at my
fingers' ends. Now, there are two
very distinct ideas, which young
people are apt to confound. If they
happen to know a pleasing song, they
fancy themselves pleasing singers:
often quite the reverse; the finer the
song, the fouler the butchery. I wish
singing was visible, and not audible;
for then we could keep it out by
shutting our eyes. Well, this is how
it was: leaning, as I was wont,
over the ship's side, my face to the
horizon, my back to the company, I
won't pretend to say that I exactly
sang for their benefit: oh no; I sang,
as I had right to do, for my own
amusement; though I certainly did
sing loud enough to be heard, without
being listened to. Presently by my
side leaned Captain Gabion. I ceased.
He hummed a mellifluous song of
Lusitania.</p>

<p>"Pity the Lisbon music-sellers
don't print their music," said he;
"Write it all. Quite a fuss, sometimes,
to get a song you fancy."</p>

<p>"That explains something I never
understood before," said I. "All
the songs I have received from Portugal
are in manuscript. Pray, what
is a modinha, strictly speaking?"</p>

<p>"Why, a modinha," replied he, "in
common parlance, means any song
that you happen to like. Modinha:
a little mode; a little fashion; any
little fashionable song. But the grand,
regular music of the Portuguese&mdash;oh!
that's magnificent&mdash;their church
music for instance. You must know,
once a-year, in one of the Lisbon
churches, they sing a grand mass for
the souls of deceased musicians. Of
course, on such an occasion, all the
living forces of the musical world are
put in requisition. The last time
I was at Lisbon, I attended&mdash;advise
you, as a musical man, to do the same.
Oh! wasn't that a grand harmonious
crash? Extraordinary fellows, some
of those singing monks and friars!
Fancy one whole side of an immense
church, from the floor to the roof, a
grand bank of chorus-singers, as high
as Shakspeare's Cliff; each bellowing
like a bull; yet each with a voice as
finely modulated as the richest violoncello,
touched by a master's hand.
Then there was one fellow, a bass, who
stood up to sing a solo. Never heard
anything like that. He struck off, deep
down in his throat&mdash;yes, sir; and
deeper down in the scale, too, than I
ever heard any man go before&mdash;with
a grand magnificent double shake,
like&mdash;like&mdash;like the flutter of an eagle.
Then down&mdash;down&mdash;down the villain
dropped, four notes lower, and
gave such another. I advised him
to go to England. His name was
Naldi. But let me see&mdash;oh&mdash;we were
talking about modinhas. Why, sir,
the fact is this&mdash;if you want to hear
what I call the vernacular basis of
the modinha, you must go up among
the hills, a few leagues out of Lisbon."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I, "my best plan
will be to go by the mail."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied he; "any one in
Lisbon will show you the booking
office: unless, by the bye, you prefer
palanquin, in which case I would
advise you to order relays of black
bearers from Jigitononha; or, you
might do it on two donkeys. Well,
sir; when you're up there in the
mountains, among the goats, wolves,
wild buffaloes and rhododendrons, the
altitude about corresponding to latitude
66° N. in Europe, and to&mdash;let
me see&mdash;latitude&mdash;say latitude 50° in
the United States&mdash;of course you'll
feel hungry. Step into the first hotel.
But I'd advise you&mdash;don't order three
courses; you'll find it come expensive;
better rough it with something light&mdash;say
a beef-steak and a bottle of port.
That buffalo beef, capital. Port&mdash;let
me see&mdash;are you particular in your
port? Better ask for the Algarve
sort. Well, sir; after you have dined,
just step out into the village&mdash;walk
into the first wine-shop. You'll probably
find half-a-dozen peasants there&mdash;big,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_687">687</span>
muscular, broad-chested, good-humoured-looking
fellows&mdash;goatherds
and all that kind of thing. Look out
for the chap with the guitar&mdash;you'll be
sure to find him in the wine-shop;
order a quart tumbler of wine&mdash;just
taste it yourself&mdash;then hand it to him&mdash;and
tell him to play. The moment
he has tossed off the tipple, he begins
tinkling. The other six fellows stand
up; throw back their shoulders; bulge
out their chests; and begin smirking,
winking their little black eyes, snapping
their fingers, and screwing their
backs in such an extraordinary manner
as you never beheld&mdash;all in
cadence to the guitar. That's the
first access of the musical &oelig;strum.
The guitar goes on&mdash;strum&mdash;strum&mdash;strum&mdash;a
low monotonous jingle, just
two or three chords. That's the accompaniment
to the singing that's
about to begin. At length, one of the
fellows commences&mdash;air and words
both extempore; perhaps something
amatory, <i>Minha Maria, minha querida</i>;
or, it may be, something satirical, if
they see anything quizzable&mdash;something
about yourself. While that
first fellow is singing, the chap next
him stands, still winking, screwing,
smirking, snapping his fingers; and
begins, as soon as the other has done.
So it goes on, till all the half-dozen
have had their turn. But the curious
thing is this: though all the songs are
different, different in the <i>tema</i>, different
in the style, different in the
compass of voice, different in the pitch,
different in the words, the same accompaniment
does duty for all: the
chap with the guitar goes on, just
tinkling the same chords, till the whole
is finished. Then, if you want it <i>da
capo</i>, give him another tumbler of
wine. If you've had enough, why,
then, you know, you can just fork out
a moidore or two, tell them to divide
it, and take your leave,&mdash;that is, if
you don't want to see the fight for the
money: but that's not worth your
while; mere rough and tumble, with
a little knifing. Only mind; don't
give dollars or patacas. They prefer
gold."</p>

<p>I really thought I was now trotting
Captain Gabion, who was a musical
amateur. Villain! he was operating
to clap the saddle on me, in a way I
little suspected. "Then," said I,
"each of these fellows, I suppose, has
sung a modinha."</p>

<p>"Why, no; not exactly that,
neither," said the Captain. "I'll tell
you. Curious sort of music it is,
though; the national music, in fact.
When you see one of those big athletic
fellows expanding his chest, sucking
his breath, his whole pulmonary region
heaving, labouring with the song he is
going to sing, why, of course you'd
expect him to break out like a clap of
thunder. But, instead of that, forth
comes from his big throat a very
mouse-like issue of those mountain
throes; an attenuated stream, not
altogether unmusical though, of
growling, grunting, squeaking cadences&mdash;for
the compass of their voices
is perfectly astonishing&mdash;a string of
wild and rapid trills, very short notes,
very long notes, mostly slurred, never
<i>staccato</i>; and, if you should happen
to notice, similar, in its intervals, to
the music of Scotland. With your
musical knowledge, of course you
understand what I mean by intervals.
Well, sir; that sort of mountain music
is what I call the national basis of the
Portuguese modinha. Take one of
those wild airs, arrange it scientifically,
with suitable symphonies, accompaniment,
and all that sort of
thing&mdash;no difficulty to <i>you</i>&mdash;the modinha
is then complete."</p>

<p>This was by no means a bad theory
of the modinha of those days; an
Italian graft upon the native stock; a
scientific modification of the music of
the peasantry; so wild, so expressive,
so sweet, so thrilling, never have I
heard songs to compare with those old
modinhas. Once, at a party in the
house of a Lisbon lady, we persuaded
her married daughter to sing; a
round, fat, rosy-brunette little dump
of a woman, famous for singing modinhas.
She kindly took her guitar,
spat in her handkerchief, and gave us
them in such style as I have never
but once heard since&mdash;and then the fair
vocalist was not a Portuguese. What
rich expression, what rises and falls,
what rapid execution, what accurate
intonation, what power, what tenderness,
what point, in that soft, flexible,
delicate, yet rich, full, brilliant, and
highly-cultivated voice! Alas, the
modinha of that day is rapidly passing
into oblivion. It has yielded in Lisbon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_688">688</span>
society to a new style of songs, still
called modinhas, the words generally
native, as they used to be; but the
music, <i>modern</i> Italian&mdash;utterly destitute
of sentiment; a constant
straining at effect, and a constant
failure.</p>

<p>"I understand," said I, "that in
every part of the Peninsula you meet
with a kind of songs that may be
called local."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Captain; "all, if
I may so say, provincial; all peculiar;
all highly characteristic; and all
excellent. Even the occasional songs
are good as compositions; that is to
say, songs which refer to politics, passing
events, and so forth. Did you
ever hear this?" He gave <i>Ya vienen
los Ingleses</i>.</p>

<p>"Very pleasing, and very lively,"
said I. "This is in the same style."
I began to strike up <i>Quando el Pepe
José</i>.</p>

<p>"Don't let's have any more Spanish,"
said the Captain. "Sing
something Portuguese." I gave <i>Os
soldados do comercio</i>.</p>

<p>"Quite humorous," said he, "but
very pleasing music. This is the
Portuguese national song." He gave
<i>Eis, Principe excelso</i>.</p>

<p>"Some of the satirical songs," said
I, "are very well set." I gave <i>Estas
senhoras da moda</i>. The Captain, I
observed, looked at his watch. Little
dreamt I the traitor was working
against time.</p>

<p>"This, now," said he, "is what
may be called the sentimental style;
short, but expressive, like the serious
epigram of the Greek Anthology."
He gave <i>Tu me chamas tua vida</i>.</p>

<p>"The finest I have heard, though,"
said I, "in that style, is the Spanish
song&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," said the Captain; "give
us something Portuguese; something
by an old Padre. They are the fellows
that knock off the best modinhas."
I gave <i>Fui me confessar</i>.</p>

<p>The conclusion of this my third
song was followed by loud shouts of
laughter, a general clapping of hands,
and cries of "Encore! encore! bravo!
viva! encore! encore!" I turned,
and stood the centre of a semicircle!
Around me were ranged the delighted,
applauding passengers; the Colonel,
the Major, Capsicum, Pledget, Gingham,
Mr Belvidere, Joey, and, oh!
leaning on Joey's arm, the lovely
Juno; the whole Party, at my expense,
in the highest possible state of
hilarity. The skipper in the background,
leaning on the binnacle, stood
surveying the whole transaction with
his face set in a sarcastic scowl, as
though it had first been cast in plaster
of Paris, and then painted with red
ochre. Kitty's bonnet appeared on
the level of the deck, projecting from
the cabin stairs. Near her, profuse
in soft attentions, stood the Colonel's
flunkey, lavishing winks and winning
simpers. Immediately above me, in
the shrouds, with his face downwards,
like a monkey in a tree, hung Snowball
the nigger; his two eyes, full of
wonder and delight, gloating like a
basilisk's, and projecting like a skinned
rabbit's; his mouth extended across
his face in so broad a grin, you'd have
thought his throat had been cut from
ear to ear. The applause having a
little subsided, each in turn paid me a
compliment. Juno, the enchanting
saucy witch, dropped me a demure
and very low curtsy, begged to thank
me, and precipitately put her handkerchief
to her face. Gingham advised
me to cultivate my voice; begged
to assure me I had very good taste,
and only wanted modulation, flexibility,
accuracy, and execution, with a
little attention to time and tune, and
care to avoid passing into the wrong
key&mdash;nay, had no doubt, if I took
pains, I should some day acquire an
<i>ear</i>. Just when I was annoyed past
bearing, Pledget, tittering with ecstasy,
whispered at my elbow, "Capital
joke! the Captain did it admirably.
Almost as good as puppies!&mdash;puppies!&mdash;puppies!"</p>

<p>"Your compliment last, sir," said
I, "comes in the proper place. Allow
me to designate it as it deserves&mdash;the
ass's kick."</p>

<p>Pledget turned a little pale, and
drew up; said something that seemed
to stick in his throat, about "lions
roaring, and asses braying."</p>

<p>We were on the edge of a regular
tiff. The general garrulity dropped
into a dead silence, and the whole
party looked concerned. The Colonel
at once interposed, and insisted on
our shaking hands. This operation
was performed accordingly, as in such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_689">689</span>
cases provided, with immense cordiality
on both sides.</p>

<p>"Captain Gabion, I'll trouble you
for a dollar," said the Major.</p>

<p>"No, no; I'll trouble <i>you</i> for a
dollar," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"
said the Major. "You've lost; that's
evident."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by lost?"
said Captain Gabion. "Didn't I
make Mr Y&mdash; sing three songs
within the given time? Hadn't I two
minutes over, when he finished the
last? Weren't they all three Portuguese?
I took good care of that.
Wasn't that our bet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain; all right," said the
Major. "But one of <i>your</i> songs was
Spanish. That was an infringement."</p>

<p>"Didn't understand any condition
of that sort," replied Captain Gabion.
"All the party heard the bet. Let
the company decide."</p>

<p>One said one thing, one another.
By common consent it was referred to
Gingham, who had held his tongue.
Gingham decided that the Captain had
lost.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Captain,
"then I have had all my trouble for
nothing. Rather hard, though, to
sing three songs yourself; get three
more out of a gentleman that has a
particular objection to singing, in
forty minutes; and then have to pay
a dollar besides. However, book it,
Major. Very kind of you, though,
Mr Y&mdash;: equally obliged. Trust
you'll often favour us." We all went
below to prepare for dinner; but I
had not heard the last of my singing.</p>

<p>We were now on the look-out for
Cape Villano, and began to feel the
N. wind which blows down the W.
coast of the Spanish Peninsula ten
months in the year. This wind, as
you get further to the S., is generally
attended with a clear sky. But in
our present latitude, meeting the
upper or S.W. current of air, which
comes charged with the vapours of
the Atlantic, it produced incessant
rain. The rain commenced, as indeed
rain often does commence, about
three o'clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and kept us below
all the evening; obliging us also to
lay-to till daybreak, as the skipper
did not like to run nearer in by night,
with such weather.</p>

<p>From dinner to tea we managed to
crack on, without finding the time
hang heavy on our hands. After tea
the conversation was resumed, but in
the course of an hour or two began to
flag; when Gingham enlivened it by
volunteering his services in brewing
a bowl of punch. The offer was received
with tumultuous applause;
except that Capsicum, who thought
nobody understood brewing so well
as himself, politely expressed a doubt
as to Gingham's capabilities. Gingham
avowed, with much seriousness,
that he "yielded in punch-making to
no man." A discussion arose, in
the course of which I ventured to
move, and it was carried, that a bowl
of punch should be brewed by each,
and that the company should award
the palm after finishing both.</p>

<p>Capsicum brewed first. The materials
were not wanting. The
steward brought rum, brandy, lemons,
all the etceteras. Gingham, chivalrous
in his rivalry, tendered limes in
lieu of lemons: "always took a few
when he travelled&mdash;got them in Pudding
Lane." Capsicum's sense of honour
would have declined the limes; but
the company ruled otherwise. The
bowl was brewed&mdash;a perfect nosegay&mdash;and
stood smoking in the centre of
the table. In a very short time after,
each man had his quantum before him.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen," said the Colonel,
(chairman,) "punch is nothing without
harmony. I beg leave to call on
Mr Y&mdash; for a song." Much applause.
"Hear! hear! hear! A song by Mr
Y&mdash;! hear! hear! hear!"</p>

<p>I had not quite recovered the adventure
of the morning, and was far
from disposed to sing. Had sung
enough for one day&mdash;felt rather hoarse&mdash;begged
to decline&mdash;but all in vain:
the company would take no denial.
I was obstinate. Joey began to talk
of keelhauling; the Major suggested
the old mess fine, a sugared oyster;
while a soft admonition was heard in
the distance, "The bird that can
sing, and that won't sing, must be
made to sing."</p>

<p>Not to sing was just then a principle
as fixed in my mind as any
theorem in the first six books of
Euclid. The company became peremptory.
At length, tired of saying
no, I rose, and begged leave to ask
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_690">690</span>
the chairman whether, if I sang, I
should have the usual privilege of
calling on any other gentleman present.
The chairman hesitated to reply.
He saw his position: I might
call upon <i>him</i>. I now had the best
of it. The chairman laughed, leaned
over to Capsicum, and whispered a
remark about "generalship." Capsicum
growled out something, of which
I could only distinguish "jockey" and
"young fox."</p>

<p>I was still on my legs, and continued,&mdash;"Well,
Mr Chairman, as
my very equitable proposal is not met
so promptly as I anticipated, would it
not be better if the company resolve,
instead of extorting a solitary song
from an individual who has already
contributed largely this day to the
common stock of amusement," (<i>hear!
hear! hear!</i>) "that every person present
should either sing a song, or tell
a story?"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>The Colonel looked quite relieved;
the company, also, appeared content.
"Well, gentlemen," said he, "as it
seems to meet your approval, suppose
we accept Mr Y&mdash;'s proposition. I
will begin. Sooner, any day, tell a
dozen stories, than sing one song.
My story, at any rate, like Captain
Gabion's last song this morning, when
he had only twelve minutes to spare,
will have the merit of being short.&mdash;A
little more punch, if you please.&mdash;Allow
me, then, to break ground, by
relating an anecdote of my esteemed
and much-lamented friend</p>

<h3>MAJOR KRAUSS.</h3>

<p>Some of you knew the Major well&mdash;are
doubtless aware, also, that in a
fit of excitement, which led to temporary
insanity, he fell by his own hand.
The circumstances, however, which
gave occasion to that melancholy
event were known only to myself.
At the time when we were forming
and drilling the Portuguese army,
which afterwards proved so effective
in the field, the Major and I were both
stationed in winter-quarters at L&mdash;.
In the same town were two regiments
of newly-raised Portuguese cavalry,
which it was requisite to have in complete
efficiency against the opening of
the campaign in the spring. The
Major&mdash;a stiff hand I need not say, a
regular Titan of the German school&mdash;was
appointed to drill one; and I,
for want of something to do, undertook
the other. In this duty, there
sprang up between us a little rivalry,
amicable of course, as to which of us
should first have his regiment ready.
The Major had his own ideas; and, I
thought, teazed his men, and exacted
too much. He had an eye to a field-day;
I had an eye to actual service.
Foreigners say, we teach our cavalry
everything, except pulling up. But I
can tell you, before an enemy superior
in force, and pressing you too close,
nothing acts more effectually as a
check, than riding through them.
Well, we both drilled according to
our views. One morning the Major
announced to me, that he considered
his regiment perfect, and that I must
go with him and inspect it. We went.
He put them through; I looked on;
they performed admirably. Finally,
he drew them up in line. Riding to
the front, he surveyed his work with
pride. Then, taking a flank position,
he made me notice how accurate the
perspective&mdash;every sabre sloped at
the same angle, everything in its
place&mdash;you might have stretched a
gardening line from one end of the
regiment to the other. Just then, unfortunately,
a new idea entered the
Major's mind: he proposed riding to
the rear. Away we went. Alas! his
discipline had not extended to the
horses' tails! Every tail was whisking:
horses, Spanish and Portuguese&mdash;all
long tails, no cock-tails&mdash;every tail in
motion. In front, they stood like a
wall: in the rear, it was whisk, whisk,
whisk,&mdash;swirl, swirl, swirl&mdash;switch,
switch, switch&mdash;all down the line. It
was too much for the poor Major. He
was perfectly dumfounded&mdash;looked
like a man out of his wits&mdash;took a
hasty leave&mdash;rode home to his billet,
and shot himself. I now beg leave to
call on Mr Y&mdash;, for either a story
or a song."</p>

<p>"I thought Major Krauss was still
living," said Pledget.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_691">691</span></p>

<p>"Mr Capsicum," said the Colonel,
"have the kindness to fill Mr Pledget
a bumper. Always the fine, you know,
if any one calls a statement in question,
when story-telling is going on. Now,
if you please, Mr Y&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," I said, "I have seen
nothing of service, and little of the
world. Perhaps, therefore, you will
permit me to relate an anecdote, which
I had from a near relative of mine, a
naval officer; and which remarkably
illustrates the characteristic coolness
of British seamen. It was the act of
a common sailor, who bore among his
messmates, in consequence, the name
of</p>

<h3>SLUICY SAM.</h3>

<p>It was at the evacuation of Toulon.
My aforesaid relative was then a lieutenant,
and had been landed with a
party from his ship, to take charge of
one of the forts in the harbour.
When Buonaparte, through the remissness
of our Spanish allies, took the
hill which commanded the anchorage,
and we were forced to withdraw, the
lieutenant received orders to bring off
his party, and the ammunition which
had been landed from the ship.
There were several barrels of gunpowder
to be brought away. These
were stowed in the after part of the
boat, between the officers and the men,
to be under inspection; and were set
on end, to save room. In pulling for
the ship, the boat had to pass another
fort, which was on fire. The English,
you know, on coming away, burnt
everything they could&mdash;that is, I
mean, everything connected with the
public service, ships, stores, storehouses,
buildings. Just as the boat
was passing, the fort blew up. The
fragments of the explosion filled the
air; and a rafter charred with fire
fell into the boat, stove in the head of
one of the powder-barrels, and stood
upright in the powder. Its superior
extremity was still burning. There
was a dead silence. The men went
on pulling, as if nothing had happened.
In an instant they might all be blown
to atoms. It seemed the easiest thing
in the world to seize the smoking and
crackling brand, pluck it out of the
powder, and throw it into the sea.
But that, doubtless, would have been
instant destruction; one spark, shaken
off in the operation and falling, would
have done the business. Everybody
saw the hitch. Still the men pulled
away. It wouldn't do to stir the
brand; and it evidently wouldn't do
to leave it where it was. "Ship your
oar, Sam," said the lieutenant. Sam,
did so. Not a word more was spoken,
or necessary. Sam coolly took off
his hat, dipped it into the sea, filled it,
carefully and thoroughly <i>sluiced</i> the
whole surface of the exposed powder
in the barrel; and then, having in this
way made all safe, slowly drew the
rafter out of the barrel, and pitched it
overboard.&mdash;I beg here to call on Mr
Commissary Capsicum."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Capsicum,
"I will tell you another boat-story;
and though the care of Providence
was singularly illustrated in the
wonderful preservation which Johnny
has just related, I think it appeared
quite as remarkably in the case which
I am about to relate, of</p>

<h3>THE MAN THAT WASN'T DROWNED.</h3>

<p>I am now a military commissary;
I was once a naval one. I made my
<i>debut</i> in the British service as a captain's
clerk, and sailed in that capacity
on board the Negotiator, 74,
which was under orders for Lisbon.
On our arrival in the Tagus, we found
there the Protocol, 120, the Pacificator,
100, the Persuasive, 80, the Conciliator,
74, the Preliminary, 50, the
Envoy, bomb, and the Intervention,
fire-ship. The next day, the captain
of the Protocol came on board, and
was invited by our own skipper to
stay and dine. But he knew the
Lisbon weather too well&mdash;foresaw a
gale; and, not relishing the idea of
getting a wet jacket in returning at
night to his ship, persuaded our skipper
to go and dine with <i>him</i>. The
Negotiator's boat was to fetch the
skipper. Sure enough, the wind freshened
about sunset, and in an hour or
two it began to blow great guns. Our
boat went, however, as arranged.
Nasty work, boating at Lisbon. You
may think it's nothing, in harbour.
But I can tell you this&mdash;whenever
there's a storm at sea, there's sure to
be a little hurricane in the Tagus.
No matter what's the direction of the
wind outside&mdash;in the Tagus you have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_692">692</span>
it right up or right down. Well,
gentlemen, Protocol advised Negotiator
not to think of returning such
a night as that&mdash;offered him a shake-down
on board&mdash;assured him he'd be
swamped&mdash;all to no purpose; Negotiator
would go, as his boat was come.
Just as they were leaving the ship's
side, one of the boat's crew fell overboard.
Every effort was made to
recover him, but with what success
you may easily suppose. The tide
was running down like a torrent; the
wind came roaring up from the bar,
and lashed the water into froth and
fury; the spray half filled the boat;
it was pitch-dark. All was done that
could be done, but to no purpose: the
man was given up for lost; the boat
returned to the ship. The skipper
came into the cabin quite sorrowful-like,
that he had lost one of his best
men, but didn't forget to tell me to
jump down into the boat, and see to
the handing up of half-a-dozen fine
melons, presented to him by Protocol.
Down I went, in the dark, over the
ship's side, got into the boat, groped
about, found five melons and handed
them up; couldn't find the sixth. I
was just stepping out of the boat to
return on board, when the thought
struck me, what a blowing-up I should
get from the skipper, when I told him
a melon was missing. I paused, renewed
my search, happened to put
my hand down to the gunnel of the
boat, to support myself in stooping.
My hand lighted upon something; it
wasn't the gunnel. I felt it&mdash;pitch-dark;
couldn't see the tip of my own
nose. It was a man's foot! I felt
further&mdash;a man's leg! Someone was
hanging on, outside the boat, with his
heel uppermost, and his head under
water. I held him fast by the leg,
and sung out for help. The man was
got on board insensible, and to all
appearance past recovery. When he
fell overboard alongside the Protocol,
he had hooked on by his foot, and in
that way had been dragged under
water all the time they had been rowing
about in the dark to find him, as
well as afterwards, while they were
pulling for the ship. We all thought
him a dead man. The doctor said,
'No: if he had been, he would have
let go.' Doctor ordered a sailor's
flannel shirt and a kettle of boiling
water; had the patient stripped, and
laid in hot blankets; rolled up the
flannel shirt into a ball, poured into it
the boiling water, and clapt it to the
pit of his stomach." (Here Pledget
took out his tablets, and made a
note.) "What with this, and other
gentle restoratives," continued Capsicum,
"the man recovered. The
skipper, glad as he was when the
doctor reported it, didn't forget to
give me a good blowing-up for the
melon, which I suppose one of the
boat's crew had grabbed in the dark."</p>

<p>"Of course he didn't forget that,"
said Joey, who had listened to this
narrative with professional interest.
"Pray, do you happen to know what
time elapsed from the man's falling
overboard till he was unhooked?"</p>

<p>"The little dog forgot to mention,"
replied Capsicum.</p>

<p>"What little dog?" said Joey
eagerly. "I am quite an <i>animal</i> man.
I am particularly fond of dogs."</p>

<p>"The little dog whose tail curled
so tight, that it lifted him off his hind
legs. Will you oblige us, Mr. Gingham?"</p>

<p>"It is extraordinary enough, gentlemen,"
said Gingham, "that though
three most interesting anecdotes have
been related, we have not yet had
either a ghost story, a love story, or a
touch of the pathetic. The first of
these omissions I will now endeavour
to supply, by relating an occurrence
which befel me during the short time
I was at school, and in which the
party most prominent was a strange
sort of an individual, who went among
the boys by the name of</p>

<h3>THE CONJUROR.</h3>

<p>He was our writing-master. He
was our ciphering-master. He was
also our drawing-master. He was a
foreigner. Not a boy in the school
knew whence he came; but he certainly
was not an Englishman. In
person he was gaunt and uncouth. He
was a mild, quiet sort of a man; but
his eye had a sinister expression,
and he was savage when provoked.
It was commonly reported
among the boys, not only that he
could do extraordinary conjuring
tricks, but that he was a master of
magic, far deeper and darker than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_693">693</span>
legerdemain. He lived alone in a
solitary cottage, which, with its garden
and long shrubbery, skirted the
road, about a mile out of the town
where was our school. This cottage
had never been entered by any of the
boys; strange stories were told about
it; and we viewed it with a sort of
awe. You must know the gentleman
in question had a remarkable habit of
sitting. When he came to us at one
o'clock, he immediately took his seat
at his desk; and never rose till his
two hours were up. This circumstance
suggested to my mind a conjuring
trick, to be played off on the
conjuror. One day, just before his
arrival, I spread some shoemakers'
wax on his bench; and afterwards,
when he was fairly seated, I gave out
among the boys that I had conjured
the conjuror, and that at three o'clock
he wouldn't be able to go. The boys
were all expectation. It struck three.
He attempted to rise&mdash;an unseen
power held him fast. At length,
amidst much tittering, he contrived
to get free; but only by extricating
himself from that part of his habiliments
which was in immediate contact
with the bench. He did not
exactly pull them off; but, poor man!
he was obliged to pull himself out of
them. The master lent him another
pair; he went home filled with rage,
but perfectly cool, having first contrived
to identify the culprit; and his
own, having been carefully detached
with a hot knife by the master's
daughter, Miss Quintilian, as the
boys called her, were sent after him
with a message of kind condolence,
packed by her fair hands in a brown
paper parcel, into which I contrived
to slip a fig-leaf. Next day he reappeared
at the usual hour. All
went on smoothly for about a fortnight.
At the end of that time, one
afternoon when I was showing up my
sum, he addressed me, observing that
I had always been particularly diligent
with my arithmetic, and that, as
the holidays were at hand, he hoped
I would do him the favour of drinking
tea with him that evening. Some of
the boys tried to frighten me&mdash;said
he bottled the thunder and lightning,
and kept it corked down, ready for
use&mdash;oh, wouldn't he give me a touch
of it? Others encouraged me. I
went. Tea over, he told me that he
had contrived a little exhibition for
my amusement; then flung open the
folding doors of the parlour, and disclosed
a large sheet, hanging as a
curtain in the doorway. 'I must
go into the next room,' said he, 'and
take the candles with me, or you will
not be able to see the exhibition.' He
withdrew, leaving me alone in the
dark, went into the next room, and
commenced the exhibition&mdash;a sort of
phantasmagoria&mdash;to me, sufficiently
surprising; for the phantasmagoria
had not at that time been brought
before the public. One of the figures
was a whole-length likeness of myself,
which suddenly vanished, and
was replaced by a skeleton. The
exhibition finished, the conjuror returned
with the lights; and, by way
of supper, treated me to a glass of
negus and a slice of seed-cake. He
then intimated that it was time for
me to think of playing the Bedfordshire
march, but that before I went
he had something to say to me, if I
would follow him into the next room.
We adjourned: and there, amongst
other strange sights, I saw one of the
identical bottles containing the thunder
and lightning&mdash;expected to be
blown up sky-high. The conjuror
now addressed me. Alluding to the
unfortunate affair of the wax, he
remarked that his conduct to me had
been uniformly kind; that he had
always encouraged me, commended
my diligence, and helped me in my
difficulties. Then, in an appealing
tone, he inquired how I could have
made such an ungrateful return, as
to play him that horrid trick of the
wax. At the same time opening a
drawer, and producing his corduroys,
he pointed out to me their damaged
condition, and put it to my best feelings,
whether that was the way to
recompense kindness such as his. I
felt at once that my conduct had been
immeasurably bad, and most humbly
expressed my compunction. 'No,'
said he, 'that is not sufficient. The
offence was public, so should be also
the reparation. Promise me that
to-morrow, before the whole school,
you will come up to my desk and
apologise.' Perhaps this was only
just; but I hesitated. He pressed
me; but I would make no such promise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_694">694</span>
'Very well,' said he, 'it is
now time for you to think of returning.
You will be sorry for your obstinacy,
perhaps, before you get back to the
school.' He then accompanied me
into the passage, and kindly helped
me on with my greatcoat. 'The
front door,' said he, 'is fastened for
the night. Here, step out this way.'
He led me through the back passage
into the garden, and opened the garden-gate,
outside of which was a field.
'There,' said he, 'follow that path,
which runs along by the side of the
shrubbery. When you have got to
the end of it you will find a gate,
which will let you into the road.
Good night.'</p>

<p>The night was splendid&mdash;a sky
without a cloud. The full moon, high
up in the heavens, shed a lustre which
gave to every prominent object the
distinctness of day. But the shrubbery,
as I skirted it to gain the road,
was dark&mdash;dark&mdash;dark. At its extremity,
however, the moment I
emerged from the garden into the
field, I descried the gate; and to that
point, with my eyes fixed upon it, I
directed my steps. Suddenly, to my
no small surprise, the gate began to
clatter and rattle, as if violently
shaken by the wind. This was the
more extraordinary, because the night
was as calm as it was brilliant; not a
breath of air was stirring. Nor was
any creature visible; yet still the gate
went on, rattle, rattle, clatter, clatter,
as if shaking itself for its own amusement.
Presently, as though violently
pushed by invisible hands, the gate
swung wide open; then began swinging
backwards and forwards, swing,
swing, backwards and forwards, first
into the road, then into the field, with
a bang of the latch at every swing.
The last time it swung fieldways, it
stood open of itself; suddenly fixed
by an unseen power at its utmost
range. Then appeared a tall dark
form, gliding into the field through
the gateway from the road, and descending
towards me by the path. It
was the form of the conjuror himself!
Yet, in its appearance, there was
something appalling, and, I may say,
unearthly. It did not step out,
neither did it altogether glide. With
a motion compounded of the two, it
first advanced one leg, then, after a
long interval, the other, still moving
towards me at a slow, uniform rate.
One arm was solemnly extended, with
the forefinger pointing to the moon:
and, as the tall image approached and
passed me, I could distinctly discern
the uplifted visage of the conjuror,
stern but calm, his head turned
slightly on one side, his brow knit,
his eyes fixed upon the moon. Without
looking behind me to see what
became of him after he passed, I
hurried on; and had already arrived
within about fifty paces of the gate,
when it again began to rattle and
swing as violently as at first&mdash;again
stood open&mdash;and again the same form
appeared, gliding, as before, from the
road into the field, and descending
towards me down the path. The arm
was still extended; the finger still
pointed majestically to the moon; the
movement also, a mixture of striding
and sliding, was still the same. But
the conjuror's face, not turned as
before towards the moon, was this
time directed towards me. The
eyes glared full in mine&mdash;but, oh,
what eyes! They had stolen the
gleam of the luminary on which they
were fixed before; each eye was a
moon! the window of a brain that
glowed internally with a white heat!
With a look of horrid vacuity fixed on
my face, again it passed; and I, not
at all coveting a third interview, cut
away for the gate, and up the road
homewards. I had no recollection of
what occurred afterwards, till I was
roused from my slumbers next morning
by Miss Quintilian, who stood by
my bedside with a lump of sugar and
something nice in a teacup, which,
<i>she said</i>, her pa had ordered me
to take. We broke up, returned to
school after the holidays, and found
a new writing-master, the conjuror's
cottage shut up, and the conjuror himself
gone&mdash;nobody knew whither. Miss
Quintilian said she would tell me how
he went, if I promised not to mention
it to her pa:&mdash;she had seen him with
her own eyes, riding away over the
church, astride on a broomstick.&mdash;Now,
sir," added Gingham, bowing to Mr
Belvidere, "I trust that you will
favour us. By the bye, Colonel, before
We proceed, hadn't I better brew my
promised bowl of punch?"</p>

<p>"My story will be a very short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_695">695</span>
one," said Mr Belvidere, who spoke
little, and, as it afterwards appeared,
had a mighty matter on his mind.</p>

<p>"The punch will take no time,"
said Gingham. "I have everything
ready."</p>

<p>The chairman, governed by the evident
sense of the company, awarded
priority to the punch. Gingham
stepped aside, the steward was smart
with the kettle, and in less than two
minutes a fresh bowl was on the table.
With such punch in Olympus, suffice
it to say, nectar had soon become a
drug. The chairman now called on
Mr Belvidere, who proceeded forthwith
to relate</p>

<h3>THE TRIAL.</h3>

<p>"I was once staying at Bath, about
fifteen years ago, and, while there,
became very thick with the officers of
an English cavalry regiment. One
day, when I dined at the mess, it so
happened that there was also present
a young gentleman, a sub, who had
joined that morning. It was a practice
in many regiments, in those days,
I suppose I need not mention, when a
sub joined, to take the first opportunity
of trying him, as it was called&mdash;that
is, trying his mettle. In the present
instance, the time fixed was dinner.
The youth was quiet and well-bred,
a little reserved, and apparently
not quite at home. Doubts were expressed
whether he would show pluck.
When dinner was on table, and we
were all assembled, the senior officer
present politely requested the young
stranger to take the office of vice; and
he, with equal politeness assenting,
seated himself at the bottom of the
table. A grim-looking countryman of
mine, the major of the regiment, a
jovial red-faced off-hand sort of a personage,
full of whisky and waggery,
was the individual appointed to make
the customary trial, and took his seat
at table to the vice-president's left.
Soup and fish removed, an attendant
placed before the young gentleman a
boiled leg of mutton. Presently the
major, addressing him, said, 'I'll
thank you for a bit of that vale.'&mdash;'I
beg your pardon,' said Mr Vice; 'I
rather think it's mutton, not veal:
shall I have the pleasure of helping
you?' The major made no reply.
Presently the major began again:
'I'll thank you for a bit of that vale.'&mdash;'I
tell you,' said the sub, 'it's not
veal; it's mutton. Shall I give you
some?' Again the major was silent.
After a pause, the major renewed the
attack: 'I'll thank you for a bit of
that vale.'&mdash;'I'll soon let you know
whether it's veal or mutton,' said the
newly-arrived, jumping up. Then,
with one hand seizing the leg of mutton
by the knuckle, with the other
the major by the collar, and wielding
the gigot like a club, he banged it
about the major's sconce till the company
interposed. The major, fairly
basted with half-raw gravy, and
dripping with caper-sauce, flung up
both his arms above his head, in an
ecstasy of delight, and, exultingly
waving his hands, exclaimed at the
top of his voice, 'He'll do! he'll do!'
Perhaps we shall now be favoured
with a story or a song by Mr Staff-surgeon
Pledget."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Colonel, laughing,
"the old major took it all with a
very good grace; a capital fellow he
was, too. Sorry to say, one of his
peepers got a little damaged, though,
on the occasion. I could not do that,
now that I am minus a claw."</p>

<p>"Why, Colonel d'Arbley!" said
Mr Belvidere, looking the Colonel
very hard in the face, "I really ought
to apologise. Wasn't at all aware that
the hero of my story was sitting at
the head of the table. Ah, I see&mdash;I
recollect. The same features; yes,
exactly. I think, though, Colonel,
you were not then quite so tall."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the Colonel, "I'm
not quite sure that I had done growing.
I entered the service young.
Now, Mr Pledget, sir, if you please."</p>

<p>"I really feel quite at a loss, sir,"
said Pledget. "I have served in different
parts of the world; but I positively
never met with anything half so
curious and interesting as the extraordinary
incidents which I have heard
this evening."</p>

<p>"Why, Pledget, man," said the
Major, "you were on the expedition
to Buenos Ayres. Come, tell us something
about those lassoing fellows, or
the lovely señoras, with their fine-turned
ankles and slaughtering eyes."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Pledget, "something
that I picked up at the Cape, on
the passage. It relates to a celebrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_696">696</span>
traveller, who was generally
known at Cape Town by the name of</p>

<h3>THE NATURALIST.</h3>

<p>While we were lying at Table Bay,
I resided for a few days on shore. It
so happened that I took up my residence
in the same lodgings which had
formerly been occupied by the traveller
in question, the well-known Mons.
V&mdash;. The landlord, antiquated,
good-humoured old Dutchman, delighted
to talk of his illustrious guest,
and told me anecdotes of him. V&mdash;,
it appears, afforded the household
much amusement. One day he had
found what he considered a very
curious green bug, which he placed,
alive, in a paper box. The green bug,
however, thought fit to make its
escape from the box, and walked
away. V&mdash;, soon missing the fugitive,
was in an agony&mdash;searched the
room&mdash;searched the house&mdash;ran about,
asking everybody he met, had they
seen his green bug? Meanwhile,
watching an opportunity while V&mdash;'s
back was turned, the landlord's son
took a hair-pencil of green paint, and
painted on a panel of the apartment
an exact fac-simile of the green bug.
Presently, in a perfect fever of excitement,
the naturalist returned, still
inquiring eagerly for his green bug.
The family looked innocent, shook
their heads, and said nothing. V&mdash;
again began to search the room, till at
length his eyes lighted on the panel.
'Ah!' he exclaimed, 'my green
bug! Ah, I have finded you now,
my dear little naughty green bug!'
'Ah non!' he added, after two or
three ineffectual attempts to pick the
picture off the panel&mdash;'ah non! it
not is my little green bug!' Whether
V&mdash; was near-sighted, I know not.
But, if so, I can easily account for his
mistaking a painted green bug for a
real one; for, gentlemen, I am slightly
near-sighted myself," said Pledget;
"and last autumn, I do assure you,
while I was out shooting on my brother's
estate in Kent, a humble-bee
got up right under my nose, and I
actually blazed away at it with both
barrels, mistaking it for a pheasant.
I know it was nothing but a humble-bee;
for my shooting companion, a
young Oxonian, my own nephew in
fact, positively assured me. I can't
help thinking I must be a little near-sighted.
Well, but that is not all
about V&mdash;. The Dutchman one day,
observing him so very curious in entomology,
collected a variety of richly-coloured
filaments from the plumage
of birds, shreds of silk, &amp;c.; then
caught some fine blue-bottles; fastened
the filaments to the blue-bottles with
gum; and, when V&mdash; was out,
turned the blue-bottles loose in his
bedroom. V&mdash; came home&mdash;went
direct to his sleeping apartment&mdash;the
whole household, assembled and listening,
stood outside in the passage.
Presently the row began. V&mdash; was
heard within, first uttering cries of astonishment
and delight, then flouncing
about the room, jumping over the bed,
capsizing the water-jug, in hot pursuit
of the nondescript varieties of the
blue-bottle. At length a heavy bang
was followed by a dead silence; then
came a cry of piteous lamentation.
The family entered, with sympathising
looks. Poor V&mdash; had broken his
shin, in an attempt to leap the table.
The females rushed for brown paper
and vinegar. The wounded man was
extricated from the upturned legs of
the table, and led out limping into the
common apartment, to be doctored.
The landlord, profiting by the opportunity,
opened the bedroom window,
and the blue-bottles escaped. The
naturalist, who never knew by what
means he had been beguiled, made
frequent, and I need not say vain, inquiries,
for similar 'prit littel bottle
blue homing-beards.'&mdash;I beg leave to
call on my friend the Major."</p>

<p>"I," said the Major, "as well as
Captain Gabion, was on the retreat to
Corunna, and now beg leave to relate
an incident connected with</p>

<h3>THE EMBARKATION.</h3>

<p>After we had served out the French,
on the heights there, just above the
town, we had no farther trouble to
signify, so far as they were concerned&mdash;a
pretty deal, though, in getting our
own army embarked. I was the last
man on shore but two. Towards the
close of the business, I went down to
the place of embarkation&mdash;found old
Blue Breeches (a sobriquet which
I had in the morning been scandalised
by hearing applied to my honoured
father) there, the officer in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_697">697</span>
charge, superintending. There he
was, up to his knees in the surf, giving
his orders, helping the wounded into
the boats with his own hands, directing
everything. Such a precious scene
of noise and confusion I never witnessed.
'Hadn't you better embark
at once, sir?' said he. 'No&mdash;I'd
rather wait a while,' said I. 'Hadn't
you better go in <i>this</i> boat?' said he.
'No, sir; I'll go in the boat <i>you</i> go
in,' said I. 'Then you'll have to
wait quite to the last; I intend to be
the last man off,' said he. 'Very
well,' said I. 'If you really mean
to wait, sir, I shall have to request
your assistance,' said he. Didn't
quite understand what that meant,
but determined to stick to Old Blue
Breeches. Don't you see? It was
my best card. You don't suppose I
was going to be boated off to a transport,
when I could go home in a
seventy-four? Well, sir, at length
the men were all embarked&mdash;the sick,
the wounded, every man John of
them. The last boat-load had shoved
off, and there now only remained the
captain's own gig, ready to take us
on board. Of course, I expected we
should be off, like the rest, without
delay. No, no; Old Blue Breeches
had a different way of doing business.
He turns round to me, and says, 'I
am, going to take a walk through the
town, sir. Will you favour me with
your company?' 'Should hardly
think there was time for that, sir,'
said I; 'but if it will answer any
purpose, and you really mean to go, I
shall be happy to go with you.'
Thought some of the French might
have got in. 'I want to look into
the different wine-houses,' said he,
'just to see if there are any stragglers.
Am ordered to bring all off: shouldn't
like to leave a man behind.' Away
we went&mdash;he, I, and old Powers, the
Irish coxswain, almost as rum an old
chap as Old Blue Breeches himself.
He searched all the wine-shops for
stragglers&mdash;found none. Besides our
three selves, there wasn't an Englishman
in Corunna. Came back through
the sally-port that opened on the
place of embarkation. At the sally-port
Old Blue Breeches made a halt,
rummaged in his pocket, brought out
the <i>key</i>. 'Took care to secure this
yesterday,' said he: 'just wait a
moment, while I lock the door.' He
locked it, and brought away the key.
Down we went to the boat. I hung
behind, wanting to be the last man
off. Old Powers was playing the
same game, but it wouldn't do.
'Now, sir, if you please,' said Old
Blue Breeches; 'company first.' In
I got. 'Won't I help yer honour
in?' said Powers to Old Blue Breeches.
'No, no, old fellow,' said he; 'that
won't do, you know. Get in first
yourself, and help me in afterwards.'
Powers grinned, and tumbled in over
the stern. Old Blue Breeches got in
last. We shoved off. 'Three cheers,
yer honour?' said Powers, as he
took his seat by the tiller. 'Ay,
ay; three cheers,' said Old Blue
Breeches; 'and may the French soon
catch such another whopping.' Three
hearty cheers by the boat's crew, and
away we pulled for the ship. Old
Blue Breeches and I, both of us pretty
considerably done up. Neither spoke
for some minutes. Thought I should
like to have that key; took a fancy
to it. 'I suppose you mean to keep
the key?' said I. 'Indeed you may
say that,' said he. 'I do mean to
keep it; and I have got another to
put to it. Last mail ashore here at
Corunna; so I was at Toulon, in
1793. Then, also, I locked the gate,
and brought away the key.' Now
that's what I call cool.&mdash;Will you
favour us, Captain Gabion?"</p>

<p>"I should esteem it a favor,"
replied the Captain, "if I might be
permitted to tell my story last. Perhaps
the gentleman opposite to me,"
(bowing to Joey,) "will have the
kindness to take his turn now. Mine
will then be the only one remaining.
Mr Chairman, will you sanction this
arrangement?" The chairman bowed.
Joey began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A previous narrator remarked,
that no one had told either a ghost-story,
a love story, or a pathetic
story. The first deficiency he himself
supplied; and, though I cannot say
that I ever saw a ghost, I certainly
never experienced anything so like
seeing one, as while I listened to that
extraordinary and appalling narrative.
I, gentlemen, have no love
story to tell, but I have a story of
true pathos; and you shall hear it, if
such is your pleasure."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">698</span></p>

<p>In token of <i>my</i> acquiescence, I
stepped to my berth, took out two white
pocket-handkerchiefs, handed one to
Joey, and kept the other ready for
use.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Joey, depositing
the disregarded cambric on the
table, "I will tell my story, but only
on one condition. It is no fiction;
and what I stipulate is this&mdash;that,
since I relate it with a heart still
wrung by recollection, as to men of
manly feeling, and in perfect good
faith, so you will listen with seriousness
and sympathy."</p>

<p>We looked at each other. Each
made up a face; all were grave, or
appeared so; and Joey, with great
earnestness of manner, and a voice
husky with emotion, commenced the
narrative of</p>

<h3>THE MONKEY AND THE CAT.</h3>

<p>"While I was serving on board
the East India Company's cruiser the
Jackal, we were one time employed
surveying in the Persian Gulf. Being
infested with rats, we one day requested
our interpreter, when he went
ashore, to bring off with him a cat
from the nearest village. He returned,
bearing in his arms, gentlemen,
such an extraordinary specimen of
feline beauty as, I will venture to
say, has never graced a British menagerie,
or sat upon any hearth-rug in
the United Empire. Her elegance,
her gentleness, her symmetry, I will
not wrong, by attempting to describe:
I should feel the poverty of the English
language. Her two eyes had each a
charm peculiar to itself. One was a
pure celestial blue, the other green as
an emerald. It was at once felt, by
every officer on board, that a creature
so superb was not to be employed in
the vulgar office of catching rats.
Our only thought was, to treat her
with the care and tenderness which
her beauty merited. As she was unquestionably
the princess of cats, and
as her coat was a soft tawny, in hue
somewhat resembling the odoriferous
powder of which our friend Mr Capsicum
makes such copious use&mdash;combining
the two circumstances, we
agreed to call her Princeza. Princeza
at once established herself as
the pet of the ship. What wonder?
We had no other domestic animal on
board, save one solitary monkey&mdash;his
name Jocko, his character, I grieve
to say, a revolting compound of artifice,
egotism, and low malignity.</p>

<p>But now a new circumstance arose,
which increased our interest in the
lovely Princeza. Almost immediately
she arrived on board, it became evident,
from unmistakable indications,
that she was about to be a mother.
Her interesting situation, indeed,
might have been detected by an
observant eye, when she first embarked.
In anticipation of the
earnestly expected event, it was
decided that Princeza should be provided
with every accommodation in the
officers' cabin. A basket, appropriated
to her use, was lined and half-filled
with the warmest and softest
materials; and in the cabin this basket
was deposited. Not that we apprehended
injury from the crew. Oh no!
our only fear was, that Princeza and
her expected little ones would be over-nursed,
over-petted, over-fed&mdash;in
short, killed with kindness. Judge,
gentlemen, what were my emotions,
when, one morning early, returning to
the cabin from my duty on deck, I
heard Princeza purring in her basket
with more than usual vehemence, and
discovered, on examination, that she
had become the happy mother of four
dear little lovely kittens." Here Joey's
voice quite broke down. At length,
mastering his emotions, he proceeded:
"Well, gentlemen; anxious to examine
the little interesting accessions,
I softly introduced my hand into the
basket. But Princeza was now a
mother, and had a mother's feelings.
Doubtless apprehending injury to her
little offspring&mdash;ah! could I have
injured them?&mdash;in an instant, poor
thing, she got my hand in chancery.
Her foreclaws, struck deep, held me
faster than a vice; with her hind claws
she rasped away the flesh, spurring
like a kangaroo; while, with her formidable
teeth, she masticated my
knuckles. After admiring awhile this
affecting illustration of maternal tenderness,
I attempted to withdraw my
hand. But, ah, gentle creature! she
only struck her claws the deeper,
spurred more vigorously, and chewed
with redoubled energy. Only by
assistance was I extricated; nor was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">699</span>
my hand perfectly recovered, till a fortnight
after Princeza was herself no
more! Well, gentlemen; for greater
security it was now resolved that,
every night at eight o'clock, Princeza's
basket should be set on the cabin table.
There it was placed the first night;
and next morning, one of the kittens
was found&mdash;can I utter it?&mdash;dead!
No malice was suspected: the disaster
was attributed to natural causes.
Another night came. We used no
precautions. In the morning, we
found another kitten&mdash;dead! Suspicion
was now awake, but overlooked
the real culprit. The third
night, I determined to watch. The
basket stood, as before, upon the
table: Princeza, with her two remaining
little ones, lay snug and
warm within: a lamp, burning near
the entrance, shed its light throughout
the cabin; and I, with my curtain all
but closed, kept watch within my
berth. In the dead of the night,
when all between decks was quiet,
save the snoring of the men, the flitting
of a shadow made me sensible
that some one, or something, was
moving in the cabin. Presently,
approaching stealthily, like Tarquin,
or Shakspeare's wolf, appeared&mdash;gentlemen,
I saw it with my eyes&mdash;the
form of Jocko! With silent
grimaces, advancing on all fours,
stealthily, stealthily, a step at a time,
he approached, he reached the table.
There awhile he paused; then threw
a somerset, and alighted upon it.
The moment he was landed, the pricked
ears and anxious face of Princeza
appeared above the basket. He approached.
She stirred not, but continued
to observe him, with all a
mother's fears depicted in her countenance.
Jocko now laid one paw
upon the basket's edge. Still Princeza
moved not. Blackest of villains! he
cuffed her&mdash;cuffed her again&mdash;again;&mdash;in
short, repeated his cuffs, till,
terrified and bewildered, the unhappy
mother leaped from the basket on the
table, from the table on the floor, and
flew out of the cabin. Then did that
monster in a monkey's form quietly
take her place, and settle himself down
for a night's rest, in the midst of the
warmth and comfort from which he
had ejected the lawful tenant. All
was now discovered. The double
murderer of the two preceding nights
lay housed and genial in that basket.
Anxious to see and know the whole,
up to this moment I had controlled
myself. But now, too hastily, I
rushed from my berth, to seize the
detected culprit. The noise alarmed
him. Snatching up a kitten in one
paw he sprang from the cabin&mdash;on
deck&mdash;up the rigging. Pursued,
though it was night, he dodged his
pursuers, taking advantage of the
gloom. At length, hard pressed, seeing
his retreat cut off and his capture
inevitable, he dashed the kitten into
the briny deep, and suffered himself
to be taken. With difficulty I preserved
him from the fury of the men.
Suffice it to say, that night he was
kept close prisoner in a hencoop, and,
next morning, hanged. But oh, how
shall I relate the sequel? The remaining
kitten was found severely
injured, crushed doubtless by Jocko's
incumbent weight, and died within
eight-and-forty hours. The mother,
bereaved of all her little ones, went
mewing about the ship as if in search
of them, languished and pined away,
refused all consolation, and expired
about eight days after. We now
became sensible of our loss in its full
extent: and this, gentlemen, was felt
by all on board to be the acme of our
grief&mdash;the ship was left without a
pet! Oh, could we have recalled
Princeza and her kittens! Oh, could
we have recalled even Jocko!"</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this tragic narrative,
which was recounted to the
end with unaffected feeling, the company
awhile remained silent, respecting
Joey's sensibilities. Joey looked
very much as if my tender of the cambric
had not been altogether superfluous.
At length the conversation was
renewed by Gingham.</p>

<p>"Your truly affecting story has a
moral, sir. I am an observer of the
habits of animals. Monkeys are very
fond of warmth."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Joey, with a
deep-drawn sigh, "I should like to
hear your moral at any rate."</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir," said Gingham,
"on board ship, what is a poor
wretch of a monkey to do? At night,
probably, he is driven to the rigging.
He would gladly nestle with the men,
but the men won't have him; for, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">700</span>
say nothing of the general ridicule a
fellow would incur by having a monkey
for his bedfellow, ten to one the
poor wretch is swarming with fleas
as big as jackasses, to say nothing of
enormous ticks in the creases of his
dirty skin. Monkeys, sir, like dogs,
scratch themselves a great deal, but
cleanse themselves very little. Now
depend upon it, when the weather is
cold and the wind high, monkeys
never sleep in trees. Is it likely then,
on board ship, that they prefer sleeping
aloft?&mdash;that is, if a monkey ever
sleeps. Did you ever see a monkey
asleep?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I ever did," replied
Joey. "I have seen them nodding.
But the moral?"</p>

<p>"The moral," said Gingham, "is
simply this. The next time you sail
with a monkey and a cat on board, if
you provide a basket for the cat, provide
another for the monkey."</p>

<p>"Obviously!" replied Joey.
"Would we had thought of that on
board the Jackal! Obviously!"</p>

<p>"May I ask," said Gingham, "how
you contrived to hang the monkey?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Joey, "he
was first pinioned."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Gingham; "so
I conjectured. Otherwise I should
consider the hanging of a monkey no
easy matter."</p>

<p>"Now, Captain Gabion, if you
please," said the Colonel, interposing.</p>

<p>"The punch is nearly out," replied
the Captain, "and, if I might be excused,
I should really feel thankful for
the indulgence. I have nothing to
tell but an ugly dream; and that
dream relates to a subject which, as I
believe my military friends here present
are aware, is constantly and painfully
present to my mind. The less
said about it the better."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Captain Gabion,"
said the Colonel; "never think of
that, man. You'll see Old England
again, I tell you, and rise to rank in
the service. Come, give us your
story."</p>

<p>It is well known that, among the
officers who embarked for the Peninsula,
there was occasionally one who
quitted his native shores with a strong
presentiment that he should never see
them again, but fall in action. In
such instances the mind retained the
impression almost constantly. It was
not the coward's fear of death&mdash;far
from it. If ever it was forgotten, the
moment was that of conflict and peril;
and then, it was sometimes realised.</p>

<p>"Come, old fellow," said the Colonel;
"your story, if you please."</p>

<p>The Captain was about to reply,
when a musical voice, pitched in alto,
was heard from the state-cabin:&mdash;"Kitty,
Kitty, come down; come
down, I tell you. You'll catch your
death o' cold, standing there in the
draught without your bonnet. Come
down, child, this instant."</p>

<p>Kitty was now seen gliding from
the foot of the cabin stairs into her
mistress's apartment. The Colonel's
keen eye glanced in that direction;
ours took the same. A pair of legs was
distinctly visible at the bottom of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Cupid, you villain! Cupid!"
shouted the Colonel, "come here;
come directly, sir. Aboard or ashore,
that rascal never misses an opportunity
of making love. Here, Cupid!
Cupid!"</p>

<p>The Colonel's gentleman, with innocence
pictured in his countenance,
now entered, stepped quietly up to the
foot of the table, and respectfully
twitched his forelock.</p>

<p>"What are you about there on the
cabin stairs, sir?" said the Colonel.
"Can't you let the young woman be
quiet, and be hanged to ye?"</p>

<p>"I vos owny a-cummin down into
the cab'n, yer honour, jist to see if
yer honour vaunted hennythink!"</p>

<p>The Colonel's gentleman, I ought
to have stated before this, was an old
light dragoon, and a Cockney. He
had lost an eye, on the same occasion
when the Colonel lost an arm; obtained
his discharge; and from that
time followed the Colonel's fortunes.
His loss, I presume, had gained him
the name of Cupid. He was a civil,
well-behaved, handy fellow enough;
had that particular way of speaking,
emphatic, and gesticulatory, which distinguishes
old soldiers who have got
their discharge; made himself universally
useful to the Colonel, and helped
him to dress and undress, morning
and evening, the Colonel being dependent
from the loss of a fin. Cupid,
in consequence, was a privileged person:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_701">701</span>
had the <i>entrée</i> of the cabin at
all times and seasons; and, being
ready and sometimes sentimental in
his replies, seldom made his appearance
amongst us without being assailed
with questions on all sides. The
Colonel was now about to give him a
regular jobation, but the Major struck
in.</p>

<p>"I say, Cupid, very convenient for
courtship those cabin stairs in rainy
weather. Eh, Cupid?"</p>

<p>"Courtship, yer honour!" said
Cupid. "I vosn't not a-doin nothink
of the kind. I vos owny a-meditatin,
like."</p>

<p>"Oh, meditating were you, though,
Cupid?" said Captain Gabion. "Well,
pray what were you meditating about?
Come, tell us your thoughts."</p>

<p>"Vhy, sir," replied Cupid, "I vos
a-meditatin upon the hair and upon
the sea. Got plenty of bofe vhere
ve now are; nothink helse, has I can
see; so it vos owny natral I should
meditate. And I vos jist a-thinkin
this: that the hair is made for men,
and the sea is made for fishes, heach
for heach; and t'other von't do for
nayther. Pull a fish hout of his own
heliment hinto the hair, and he dies.
And pitch a man hout of his own
heliment hinto the sea, and he's
drownded."</p>

<p>"Really, Cupid," said Capsicum,
"that never struck me before. It's
very curious."</p>

<p>"Wherry," said Cupid. "But,
please yer honour, I thought of somethink
helse, vitch I consider it's more
kew-russer still. And that's this:
that, though too much vorter drownds
a man, and too much hair kills a fish,
yit a fish can't do vithout a little hair,
and a man can't do vithout a little
drink." Cupid's eye, as if he had said
too much, dropped, and fell upon the
punch-bowl.</p>

<p>Amidst the general applause and
merriment excited by this appeal, I
pushed over a tumbler to Joey, who
took up the punch-bowl, and soon
transferred its remaining contents into
the glass, which he handed, brimming,
to Cupid. The next moment it stood
empty on the table. Cupid smacked
his lips.</p>

<p>"Cupid," said the Colonel in a tone
of authority, "what's your opinion of
that punch?"</p>

<p>"Pertickerly obleeged to yer honour,"
replied Cupid, "and to haul
the company vot's present." Cupid
then made a nip at his knee, as if
suddenly bit; and, availing himself of
the stoop, whispered Joey: "Please,
sir, did the Cornal brew it hisself?"
With a twitch of the mouth, and a
twist of the eye, Joey indicated
Gingham.</p>

<p>"Come, Cupid," said the Colonel,
"I want a direct answer. Tell me
your opinion of that punch." The
Colonel had a plot.</p>

<p>"Bless yer art, yer honour," said
Cupid.</p>

<p>"Come, speak up, sir," said the
Colonel.</p>

<p>"Speak up, man," said Gingham.</p>

<p>"Vell, yer honour," said Cupid, "I
haulvays speaks the troof, except I'm
hordered the contary. Pleasant tipple,
wherry. But if so be I hadn't not
a' seed it in the punch-bowl, vhy, I
shouldn't not a' knowed it <i>vos</i> punch,
not no how."</p>

<p>"What drink do you like best,
Cupid?" said the Major. "What
d'ye think of water, now?"</p>

<p>"Vhy, I think this, yer honour,"
replied Cupid: "I'm a pertickler dislike
to vorter; that's vot I think. I
vouldn't ride no oss into no vorter,
no, not for nothink."</p>

<p>"The fact is, gentlemen," said the
Colonel, "Cupid thinks no man can
brew a bowl of punch like himself.
What say you?&mdash;shall we give him a
trial?"</p>

<p>Capsicum consented&mdash;Gingham
consented&mdash;we all consented. The
third bowl of punch was carried by
acclamation. Cupid retired to brew.</p>

<p>"If he beats mine," said Capsicum,
"I'll give him half-a-guinea for the
recipe."</p>

<p>"A guinea," said the Colonel,
"with a promise not to communicate.
Cupid never takes less."</p>

<p>Cupid returned with the punch-bowl,
having executed the arcana
aside. His punch had the aroma of
arrack, though not arrack punch in
the strict sense of the word. Capsicum's
was a nosegay; Gingham's beat
nectar; but Cupid's put them both
out of court, by consent of the company.
"Now, Captain Gabion," said
the Colonel, "we'll trouble you for
your story."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">702</span></p>

<p>"Without disparagement of our
previous brewers," said the Captain,
"my feeling at the present moment is
just this, that I never drank punch
before. Well, gentlemen, if you will
have it so, I proceed to relate</p>

<h3>MY DREAM.</h3>

<p>Some of the friends here assembled
are well aware&mdash;why should I conceal
it?&mdash;that, for several months past, a
load has been pressing on my mind.
They are also aware of the cause. I
certainly have an impression that I
shall never see England again. But
how that impression began, they are
not aware. What I am now about
to relate will afford the explanation.
Yet what is the subject of my narrative?
A dream&mdash;a mere dream; and
a dream easily accounted for by the
circumstances in which it was dreamt.
So it is. Colonel d'Arbley knows,
the Major knows, that I never shrank
from peril. I have faced death; to
all appearance, certain death. And,
unless I felt prepared to do the like
again, I should not have been now
returning to the army;&mdash;no, I would
rather have quitted the service. Death
I am prepared at any time to meet;
yet this presentiment of death is a
burden upon my spirits. By the bye,
my glass is empty. Hadn't I better
replenish it ere I begin?</p>

<p>You are aware, sir, that ill health,
the effect of hard service and hard
knocks, obliged me to return to England
last spring. In the course of
the autumn, I quitted Cheltenham, and
resided at Woolwich. There, I was at
a military party. We kept it up all
night. Next morning, I was unexpectedly
summoned to London; and,
on my arrival, found work cut out for
me,&mdash;papers to be prepared&mdash;public
offices to be visited&mdash;lots of going
about&mdash;lots of writing&mdash;all wanted
instantly. Some parliamentary wretch
had moved for returns, and I was to
get them up. In short, the work could
be done in time only by my again
sitting up all night. It was on the
day after these two sleepless nights
that I had my dream. Where, do
you think? And at what hour? At
noon, with the sun shining above my
head, on a bench in St James's Park.</p>

<p>I had just been calling in at the
Horse-Guards for a chat, my business
completed, the excitement over, and
was proceeding westward on foot along
the Birdcage Walk, when I began to
feel nervous and done up. All at once,
my faculties experienced a sort of collapse.
My whole frame was seized
with a deadly chill; I shivered spasmodically;
my strength seemed gone;
and I became most enormously drowsy.
Just at that moment&mdash;I suppose it
was some anniversary, a birthday
perhaps&mdash;bang, bang, the Park guns
commenced firing, close at hand. In
the midst of the firing, I sat down on
a bench, and, in no time, dropped
asleep. Then began my dream.</p>

<p>It was a general action. The curious
circumstance is, that I was still in the
Park. The guns firing a holiday
salute became the French position,
which occupied the plateau of a low
range of hills. At the foot of this
range, in an avenue extending along
its foot, was I alone. The firing went
on, bang-banging, now no longer a
<i>feu-de-joie</i>&mdash;the report was that of
shotted guns. I heard not only their
discharge, but the moan of the balls,
and the whisk of the grape; yes, and
the rattle of musketry, the shouts of
men charging, and all that kind of
thing. I saw the dust, the smoke,
the occasional flash, quite as much as
you can see of any battle if you're in
it. Yet, all this time, I knew I was
in the Birdcage Walk. Presently, in
the direction of the Green Park, I
heard a more distant cannonade, which
was that of the British position. It
was now time to change mine; for
some of the shot from our guns began
to pass up the avenue, close to me,
tearing, rasping up the gravel, crashing
among the trees, cutting down
boughs, and rifting the trunks. Yet
something kept me fixed. At length,
looking in the direction of the British
position, I distinctly saw a round-shot
come hopping up the avenue&mdash;hop&mdash;hop&mdash;hop&mdash;nearer
and nearer&mdash;but
slowly&mdash;slowly&mdash;slowly; it seemed all
but spent. Just when I thought it
had done hopping, it took one more
jump, and, with a heavy pitch, fetched
me an awful polt in the right side.
That moment I felt that I was a dead
man; killed in action, yet by a friendly
ball, and while sitting on a bench in
St James's Park! The vision now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">703</span>
passed. The noise and firing ceased;
troops, smoke, dust&mdash;all the concomitants
of combat vanished; the Birdcage
Walk and its beautiful environs
resumed their ordinary appearance.</p>

<p>Presently, while still sitting on the
bench, I was accosted by a tall sallow-looking
gentleman in black, who
smirked, bowed, and handed me a
letter with a broad black border&mdash;the
seal, a tombstone and a weeping willow.
It was addressed to myself&mdash;an
invitation to attend a funeral. I
pleaded my engagements&mdash;wanted to
get back to Woolwich&mdash;begged to be
excused. 'Sir,' said he, in courteous
accents, 'you really must oblige us.
Unless you are present, the funeral
cannot take place. Hope you won't
disappoint us, sir. I am the undertaker,
sir.' I somehow felt that I had
no choice, and went. The gentleman
in black met me at the door.</p>

<p>Other parties were assembled at the
mansion; but not one of the company&mdash;I
thought it rather strange&mdash;either
spoke to me, or looked at me, or
showed the least consciousness of my
presence. The undertaker was all
attention; handed round black kid
gloves; fitted first one with a hatband,
then another; and, last of all, addressed
me: 'Now, sir, if you please,
this way, sir; we only wait for you,
sir.' I followed him. He led me into
an adjoining apartment, where stood
the coffin, surrounded by mutes. I
wished to read the name on the lid,
but was prevented by the pall.</p>

<p>How we got to the place of interment,
I recollect not. The only thing
I remember is this: as I saw the
coffin carried down stairs, hoisted into
the hearse, conveyed, hoisted out, and
at last deposited by the side of the
grave&mdash;every movement, every jolt,
every thump, seemed to jar my whole
system with a peculiar and horrid
thrill. The service was performed,
the coffin was lowered, the grating of
the ropes grated upon my very soul;
and the dust sprinkled by the sexton
on its lid blew into my mouth and
eyes, as I stood by the brink of the
grave, and looked on. The service
concluded, the undertaker, attendants,
and company withdrew; and, what
d'ye think?&mdash;there was I left remaining
in the burial-ground, with no companion
but a solitary gravedigger!
He set to work, and began shovelling
in the clods, to fill the grave. I heard
their thud; I seemed to feel it, as
they rattled in quick succession on the
lid of the coffin.</p>

<p>'You'll soon be filled in and all
right, old feller,' said the gravedigger,
as he proceeded with his work.</p>

<p>A strange idea had gradually occupied
my mind. It seemed absurd&mdash;impossible;
and yet it offered the
only conceivable solution of my sensations
at that horrid moment. I
addressed the gravedigger,&mdash;</p>

<p>'My friend,' said I, 'have the
goodness to inform me <span class="smcap">WHOSE</span> funeral
this is.'</p>

<p>'Whose funeral?' replied the
gravedigger. 'Come, that's a good
un. Vhy, it's <span class="smcap">YOUR OWN</span>.'&mdash;I'll trouble
you for a little more punch."

<h2 id="SPAIN_UNDER_NARVAEZ_AND_CHRISTINA">SPAIN UNDER NARVAEZ AND CHRISTINA.</h2>

<p>The condition of Spain since the
last French revolution, and especially
since the commencement of the present
year, has been taken as a theme of
unbounded self-gratulation by persons
who ascribe her tranquillity and
alleged prosperity to their own patriotism
and skill. For many months
past, the friends, organs, and adherents
of the dominant Camarilla have not
ceased to call attention to the flourishing
state of the country; repeatedly
challenging the Continent to produce
such another example of good government,
internal happiness, and external
dignity, as is now afforded by the
fortunate land which their patrons and
masters rule. When so many European
states are revolutionised and
unsettled, it is indeed pleasant to hear
this good report of one which we have
not been accustomed to consider a
model for the imitation of its neighbours.
Delightful it is to learn that
Spain has cast her blood-stained
slough of misrule, discord, and corruption,
and glitters in renovated comeliness,
an example to the nations, a
credit and a blessing to herself, a
monument of the disinterested exertions
and unwearied self-devotion of
her sage and virtuous rulers. We are
anxious to believe that these glowing
accounts are based upon fact, and
worthy of credence&mdash;not a delusion
and a blind; and that the happiness
and prosperity so ostentatiously
vaunted exist elsewhere than in the
invention of those interested in proclaiming
them. But we cannot forget
that the evidence produced is entirely
<i>ex-parte</i>, or lose sight of the great
facility with which the French and
English press and public accord credit
and praise to the present government
of Spain, simply on its own or its
partisans' assertions of the great things
it has done, and is about to do. It is
not easy to obtain a correct knowledge
of the condition of the bulk of the
Spanish nation. That the country
prospers means, in the mouths of the
schemers and place-hunters of Madrid,
and of the smugglers of the frontier,
that there is a brisk flow of coin into
their own pockets. That it is tranquil
signifies that no rebellious banner is
openly displayed in its territory. No
matter that the government is carried
on by shifts, by forced loans and forestalled
taxes and ruinous contracts;
that the public servants of all grades,
irregularly paid, and with bad examples
before them, peculate and take
bribes; that the widow and the orphan,
the maimed soldier and the superannuated
pensioner, continually with
long arrears due to them, are in rags,
misery, and starvation; that to the
foreign creditor is given, almost as a
favour, no part of the interest due upon
the capital he has disbursed, but the
interest on a small portion of the
accumulation of unpaid dividends;
that the streets and highways swarm
with mendicants, and are perilous from
the multitude of robbers; that the
insecurity of life and property in
country-places drives the rich proprietors
into the towns, and prevents their
expending their capital in the improvement
of their property; and that the
peasantry, deprived of instruction,
example, and encouragement, deprived
too, by the badness and scarcity of
the communications, of an advantageous
market for their produce, sink,
as a natural consequence, daily deeper
into sloth, ignorance, and vice. What
matter all these things? The miseries
of the suffering many are lightly
passed over by the prosperous few:
in Spain the multitude have no voice,
no remedy but open and armed resistance.
Thus it is that Spanish revolutions
and popular outbreaks startle
by their suddenness. Until the victim
openly rebels, his murmurs are
unheard: the report of his musket is
the first intimation of his misery. In
England and in France, abuses, oppression,
and injustice, of whatever
kind, cannot long be kept from the
light. It is very different in Spain,
under the present <i>régime</i>. There the
liberty of the press is purely nominal,
and no newspaper dares denounce an
abuse, however flagrant, or speak above
its breath on subjects whose discussion
is unpleasing to the governing powers.
On the first indication of such presumption,
number after number of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">705</span>
offending journal is seized, fines are
inflicted, and if the editors audaciously
persevere, they may reckon with
tolerable certainty on exile or a prison.
On the other hand, the ministerial and
Camarilla organs, those of the Duke
of Valencia and of Señor Sartorius,
and of the dowager queen, and even
of the dowager's husband&mdash;for his
Grace of Rianzares follows the fashion,
and has a paper at his beck, (partly
for his assistance in those stock exchange
transactions whose pursuit
has more than once dilapidated his
wife's savings,)&mdash;papers of this stamp,
we say, carefully disguise or distort
all facts whose honest revelation
would be unpleasant or discreditable
to their employers. From the garbled
and imperfect statements of these
journals, which few Frenchmen, and
scarcely any Englishmen, ever see, the
"Madrid correspondents" of French
and English newspapers&mdash;not a few
of whom reside in Paris or London&mdash;compile
their letters, and editors
derive their data (for want of better
sources) when discussing the condition
and prospects of Spain. Hence spring
misapprehension and delusion. Spain
is declared to be prosperous and happy;
and Spanish bondholders flatter themselves,
for the hundredth time, with,
the hope of a satisfactory arrangement&mdash;to
which their great patience certainly
entitles them, and which they
might as certainly obtain were the ill-administered
revenues of Spain so
directed as to flow into the public
coffers, and not into the bottomless
pockets of a few illustrious swindlers,
and of the legion of corrupt underlings
who prop a system founded on immorality
and fraud. The system is rotten
to the core, and the prosperity of Spain
is a phantom and a fallacy. Not that
she is deficient in the elements of
prosperity: on the contrary, the
country has abundant vitality and
resource, and its revenue has been for
years increasing, in the teeth of misgovernment,
and of a prohibitive
tariff, which renders the customs'
revenue almost nominal. But it matters
little how many millions are collected,
if they be intercepted on their
way to the exchequer, or squandered
and misappropriated as soon as
gathered in.</p>

<p>In the absence of better evidence as
to the real state of the country than
that whose untrustworthiness we have
denounced, the narrative of an unprejudiced
and intelligent traveller in
Spain has its value; and although the
title of a recently published book by
Mr Dundas Murray,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> proclaimed it to
refer but to one province, yet, as that
province comprises many of the principal
Spanish posts and cities, we
hoped to have found in his pages confirmation
or correction of our opinion
as to the true condition of the nation,
and more particularly of those middling
and lower classes whose welfare
is too frequently lost sight of in
the struggles and projects of political
factions. Since those pleasant "Gatherings"
in which many home-truths
were told with a playful and witty
pen, no book on Spain worth naming
has appeared; and if Mr Murray's
visit be recent, which he does not enable
us to decide, he had abundant
opportunity during his pretty long
residence and active rambles&mdash;aided,
as we learn he was, by thorough
familiarity with the language&mdash;to collect
materials for a work of no common
interest and importance. He has
preferred, however, to skim the surface:
the romantic and the picaresque,
sketches on the road and traditions of
Moorish Spain, are evidently more to
his taste than an investigation of the
condition of the people, and an exposure
of social sores and official corruption.
His book is a slight but
unaffected production, containing
much that has been said before, a
little that has not, some tolerable descriptions
of scenery, a number of
legends borrowed from Conde and
other chroniclers, and here and there
a little personal incident which may
almost pass muster as an adventure.
Young Englishmen of Mr Murray's
class and standard of ability, who
start on a tour in Spain, are of course
on the look-out for the picturesque,
and think it incumbent on them to
embody their experiences and observations
in a book. Such narratives
are usually praiseworthy for good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">706</span>
feeling and gentlemanly tone; and
indeed would be almost perfect, did
they combine with those qualities the
equally desirable ones of vigour and
originality. But doubtless we shall
do well to take them as they come,
and be thankful; for it is not every
one who has fortitude and courage to
travel for any length of time in the
flea-and-robber-ridden land of Spain.
And as we cannot expect to meet
every day with a Widdrington, a
Carnarvon, or a Ford, so we must
welcome a Murray when he presents
himself, look leniently upon his repetitions,
and be grateful if he occasionally
affords us a hint or a text. It is
perhaps a pity that Englishmen do
not more frequently turn their steps
towards the Peninsula, instead of pertinaciously
pursuing the beaten tracks
of Italy, Switzerland, the Levant;
the furthest of which is now within
the leave-of-absence ramble of a desultory
guardsman or jaded journalist,
covetous of purer air than Fleet Street
or St James's afford. Spain, we can
assure all who are rovingly inclined&mdash;and
Mr Murray, we are certain, will
corroborate our word&mdash;has at least as
much to interest as any of the above
regions, and much more than most of
them. And assuredly an influx of
British travellers would, by putting
piastres into the pockets of the aborigines,
do more than anything else towards
improving roads, towards
cleansing ventas of the <i>chinches</i> and
other light cavalry, against whose
assaults Mr Murray was fain to cuirass
himself in a flannel bag, towards
ameliorating the Iberian cuisine, and
diminishing the numbers and audacity
of the knights of the road. For, as
regards the last-named peril, greatly
increased by the dispersion of the republican
and Carlist bands, and by
the misery prevalent in the country,
Englishmen, if they have the reputation
of travelling with well-filled
pockets and portmanteaus, have also
that of fighting stoutly in defence of
their property; and if they would
make it a rule to travel two or three
together, with light purses, a sharp
look-out, and a revolver a-piece&mdash;or,
as Mr Murray and his companion did,
each with a double-barrel on his
shoulder&mdash;they might rest assured
there are not many bands of brigands
on Spanish roads bold enough to bid
them, in the classical phrase of those
gentry, "<i>Boca abajo!</i>" which means,
freely interpreted, "Down in the
dust, and <i>with</i> the dust!" But let the
traveller be on his guard against a
surprise, and, to that end, avoid as
much as possible all night-travelling,
especially by diligence, which to
many may seem the safest, on account
of the society it insures, but which is
in reality the most dangerous mode of
journeying, for there the pusillanimous
hamper and impede the resistance
contemplated by the bold, and the
bravest man can do little when jammed
in amongst screaming women and
terrified priests, with a carbine pointing
in at each window of the vehicle.
We find Mr Murray and his friend
riding unmolested through an ambuscade
where, a couple of hours later,
three <i>calesas</i> full of travellers, including
a colonel in the army, were
assailed by no more than three highwaymen,
and deliberately and unresistingly
plundered. For the traveller
in Spain there is nothing like the
saddle, whether for safety, independence,
or comfort; and as to time,
why, if he is short of that, he had
better not visit the country, for there
all things go <i>despacio</i>, which means
not with despatch but leisurely, and
for one "to-day" he will get twenty
"to-morrows," and most of these
will never come. And, above all, let
him put no faith in the word police,
which, in Spain, is a mere figure of
speech, the thing it indicates never
appearing until it is not wanted; and
let him not reckon on an escort,
which is rarely to be obtained even
by paying, and on roads notoriously
dangerous, except by tedious formality
of application, to which few will
have patience to submit. And even
if granted, it usually, as in the case of
the <i>calesas</i> above cited, is either too
weak to be useful, or lags behind, or
fairly turns tail. To which prudent
course it is more than suspected that
the faithless guards, who are mostly
pardoned robbers, are frequently stimulated
by promise of a share of the
spoil. Nor are they, if all tales be
true, the only class in Spain whose
duty it is to protect the public, and
who foully betray their trust. During
this present year of 1849, cited as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">707</span>
so prosperous a one in Spain, robberies
in the capital, and on the roads
within a radius of twenty leagues
around it, have been so numerous and
audacious, and perpetrated with such
impunity, that the finger of public
suspicion has pointed very high, and
the strangest tales&mdash;which to English
ears would sound incredible&mdash;have
been circulated of the collusion of personages
whose rank and position
would, in any other country, preclude
the idea of participation, however
secret and indirect, in gains so lawless
and iniquitous. But in this, as in
many other matters peculiar to the
Peninsula, although the few may be
convinced, the many will always
doubt, and proof it is of course
scarcely possible to obtain. In so
extensive and thinly peopled a land
as Spain, and which has been so long
a prey to civil war and insurrection,
security of travelling in rural districts,
and on cross roads, is only to
be obtained by increased cultivation
of the soil, and by improving the
condition of the peasantry. But in
the capital, and on the roads leading
to it, and in the towns and villages,
some degree of law and order might
be expected to prevail. A glance at
the Spanish papers, any time for the
last six months, proves the contrary
to be the case. Their columns are
filled with accounts of atrocious assassinations
and barefaced robberies in
the very streets of Madrid; of diligences
stopped, and travellers plundered
and abused; of farmers and
others carried off to the mountains in
open day, and detained until ransomed;
and with letters from all parts
of the country, complaining of the insecurity
of life and property, and of
the sluggishness and inefficiency of
the authorities. Such statements are
of course rarely admitted into the
ministerial prints, to read which one
would imagine that the very last
malefactor in the country had just
fallen into the hands of the <i>guardias
civiles</i>, and that a virgin might conduct
a gold-laden mule from Santander to
Cadiz, unguarded and unmolested.</p>

<p>Since the death of Ferdinand, no
such opportunity of improving and
regenerating Spain has been afforded
to a Spanish ministry, really solicitous
of their country's good, as during the
present year. It opened inauspiciously
enough; with an impoverished exchequer,
a ruinously expensive army,
Cabrera and ten thousand Carlists in
arms in eastern Spain, and with insurgent
bands, of various political denominations,
springing up in Navarre
and other provinces. There was every
prospect of a bloody civil war in early
spring. But causes, similar to those
which, on former occasions, had frustrated
their efforts, again proved fatal
to the hopes of the Carlist party.
With great difficulty, and with little
aid beyond that of contributions levied
in Catalonia, Cabrera had subsisted
his troops through the winter. But,
when spring approached, money was
needed for other purposes besides
mere rations. In the civil wars of
Spain, gold has often been far more
efficacious than steel to overcome difficulties
and gain a point. But gold
was hard to obtain. Revolutions had
raised its value; and those who possessed
it were loath to embark it in so
hazardous a speculation as the restoration
of Count Montemolin. This
prince, who, for a Spanish Bourbon,
is not deficient in natural ability, has
one unfortunate defect, which more
than counterbalances his good qualities.
Infirm of purpose, he is led by
a clique of selfish and unworthy advisers,
some of whom&mdash;evil counsellors
handed down to him by his
father&mdash;have retained all the influence
they acquired over him in his childhood.
Amidst the petty wranglings
and deplorable indecisions of these
men, time wore away. A sum of
money (no very large one) was all
that was needed to achieve a great
object, which would at once have multiplied
fifty-fold the prestige of the
Montemolinist cause, and have placed
vast resources at the disposal of its
partisans. Between the sum required
and the advantage certain to be obtained,
the disproportion was enormous.
Letter after letter was received
from Cabrera and other promoters
of the Montemolinist cause
in France and Spain, urging and imploring
that, at any sacrifice, the
money should be procured. But this
was beyond the power of the incapable
<i>ojalateros</i> who surrounded the young
pretender. Without conduct, energy,
or dignity, they had not a single quality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">708</span>
calculated to obtain credit or induce
confidence. In all their attempts they
miserably failed. At last, towards
the end of March, a rumour was spread
abroad that Count Montemolin was
on his way to Catalonia, to head his
faithful adherents. Soon this was
confirmed by newspaper paragraphs,
and presently came a romantic account
of his arrest on the frontier, when
about to enter Spain. The next news
was that of his return to England,
which was almost immediately followed
by an article in a London paper,
denying point-blank that he had ever
left this country, declaring that the
journey was a hoax, and that the
Spanish prince had been arrested by
proxy. And although this article,
which was extensively copied by the
press of England and the Continent,
elicited an angry contradiction from
a hanger-on of Count Montemolin,
yet many persons, of those most versed
in the intricacies of Spanish intrigue,
were convinced that its statements
were founded on fact, and that the
Count was in reality secreted in London
at the very time he was supposed
to be travelling towards the Pyrenees.
And some of his own partisans, who
credited the reality of the journey, declared
their conviction from the first
to have been, that he would be betrayed
before he got through France,
since by that means only could certain
individuals, who dared not refuse to
accompany him, hope to return to
the flesh-pots and security of their
London home, and to avoid encountering
the perils and hardships of
mountain warfare. The abortive
journey or clumsy hoax, whichever
it was, gave the finishing stroke
to the Catalonian insurrection. Cabrera,
seeing plainly that nothing was
to be hoped from the feeble and
pusillanimous junta of advisers who
swayed and bewildered Count Montemolin
by their intrigues and dissensions,
found it necessary, after
sending repeated and indignant letters
and messages to London, to abandon
a contest which it was impossible for
him to maintain single-handed, and
from which many subordinate chiefs,
and a large portion of his troops, had
already seceded. His little army fell
to pieces, and he himself fell into the
hands of the French authorities, by
whom, after a brief detention, he was
allowed to go at large. The game
was now good for General Concha and
his fifty thousand men. The scattering
and hunting down of the broken
bands of insurgents was exactly the
sort of amusement they liked; a fine
pretext for magnificent bulletins, and
the easiest possible way of gaining
praise, honours, and decorations. Before
summer came, Catalonia was
quiet. The most vigorous effort made
by the Carlists since the Convention
of Bergara; the one offering the best
chances of success, and on which the
very last resources of the party,
(even, it is said, to a few jewels and
pictures of price&mdash;the last relics of
princely splendour,) had been expended;
the effort, in short, of whose
happy issue such sanguine expectations
were entertained, that some of
the leading adherents of the cause declared
that, "if they failed this time,
they deserved never to succeed," had
terminated in complete abortion. On
the sierras of Spain not a Carlist
cockade was to be seen; in the coffers
of the party not a dollar remained.
Many of its most valued members,
disgusted by the weakness of their
prince, and by the baseness of his councillors,
withdrew from its ranks, and
made their peace with the existing
government. And now the most
steadfast well-wishers of Count Montemolin
are compelled to admit, that
few contingencies are less probable
than his installation on the Spanish
throne.</p>

<p>Delivered from the disquietude and
expense of civil war, backed by an
overwhelming majority in the Chambers,
and having no longer anything
to fear from that "English influence,"
of which the organs of Christina and
Louis Philippe had made such a bugbear,
the Spanish government, it was
expected, would deem the moment
favourable for those reforms so greatly
needed by the country. It was full
time, and it was now quite practicable,
to adopt extensive and systematic
measures of retrenchment in the
various departments of the administration;
to reduce the army; to regularise
and lessen the expense of collecting
the revenue, which, like a crop
intrusted to negligent and dishonest
reapers, is wasted and pillaged in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">709</span>
gathering; to encourage labour and
industry; to stimulate private enterprise,
to which the tranquillity of
Spain was sure to give a first impetus;
to encourage and co-operate in the
formation of roads and canals, so
essential to agriculture, which there
languishes for want of them; to give
a death-blow to smuggling by an
honest and sweeping reform of the
absurd tariff; and, if they could not
give money to the public creditor, at
least to come to a loyal understanding
and arrangement with him, instead of
vexatiously deluding him with fair
promises, never kept. Instead of at
once, and in good faith, setting about
these, and many other equally requisite
reforms, in whose prosecution
they would have been supported
by a large number of their present
political opponents; instead of riveting
their attention on the internal maladies
and necessities of the country,
and striving strenuously for their cure,&mdash;turning
a deaf ear to the clamorous
voices abroad in Europe, and thanking
heaven that the position and
weakness of their country allowed her
to stand aloof from the struggles of
her neighbours&mdash;what did the Spanish
government? They acted like a
needy spendthrift who, having suddenly
come into possession of a little
gold, fancies himself a Cr&oelig;sus, and
squanders it in luxurious superfluities.
They had come into possession of a
little tranquillity&mdash;in Spain a treasure
far rarer and more precious than
gold&mdash;and, instead of using it for
their necessities, they lavished it
abroad. Aping wealthy and powerful
nations, they aspire to interfere in
the domestic affairs of others, before
thinking of putting their own house
in order. Rome is to be the scene of
their exploits, religion their pretext,
the Pope the gainer by their exertions.
From their eagerness in the crusade,
it might be supposed that Rome and
the pontiff had some great and peculiar
claim on the gratitude and exertions
of Spain; with which country, on the
contrary, ever since the death of Ferdinand
of petticoat-making memory, until
quite recently, they have been on the
worst possible terms&mdash;the Holy See
having openly supported the cause of
Don Carlos, refused the recognition of
Isabella, and the investiture of the
prelates she appointed, and played a
variety of unfriendly pranks, of no
material consequence, but yet exceedingly
painful and galling to the
bigoted portion of the nation, who
considered their chances of salvation
not a little compromised, so long as
their government was thus in evil
odour and non-communication with
the head of the Church. Altogether,
the attitude assumed by Rome towards
Spain, since 1833, was most
detrimental to Queen Isabella, because
it sent a vast number of priests (always
active and influential partisans)
to the side of the Pretender. Considering
these circumstances, when
Rome at last, at its own good time,
and in consideration of concessions,
and also because it suffered pecuniarily
by the duration of the rupture, again
took Spain into favour, and acknowledged
her queen as Most Catholic,
Spain, in her impoverished condition,
would surely have sufficiently responded
by her best wishes for the prosperity
of the Pope, and for the safety of
his pontifical throne. She might also,
if it was desired, have sent that poetical
statesman, M. Martinez de la Rosa,
to display his eloquence in Italian
counsels. But Spanish pride, the
bigotry of the queen-mother and her
son-in-law, the fanaticism of some,
and the hypocrisy of others, could
not be contented with this. Pinched,
starved, indebted, as Spain is, nothing
would serve but to despatch to Italy,
at heavy cost, a useless <i>corps d'armée</i>.
Little enough has it achieved. The
troops have got a bad name by their
excesses, and the generals have been
treated slightingly, almost contemptuously,
by the French commanders,
who, doubtless, at sight of the half-disciplined
Dons, felt old animosities
revive, and thought how much they
should prefer a trip to the Trocadero
to this inglorious and unprofitable
Italian campaign. To console General
Cordova and his staff, however,
for the necessity of playing second
fiddle to the French, they have been
praised, and caressed, and decorated
by his Holiness, and by that enlightened
monarch, Ferdinand of Naples;
and they have been allowed to send
an aide-de-camp to Barcelona for
three nice little Spanish uniforms,
which they are to have the honour of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">710</span>
presenting to three nice little Neapolitan
princes. Whilst this popinjay
general and his men-at-arms idle their
time, and spend their pay, in Italian
quarters, the Moors besiege and cannonade
the Spanish possessions in
Africa, within sight of the Andalusian
coast, whence not a soldier is sent to
the assistance of the beleaguered garrisons.
A most characteristic sample
of "things of Spain." In this country
we are blind to the propriety of leaving
your own barn to be pulled down,
whilst you build up your neighbour's
mansion. And, to our matter-of-fact
comprehension, it seems dishonest
to waste money in a frivolous foreign
expedition, when starving creditors
are knocking at the door. But
we are a shop-keeping people, and it
is folly to subject Spanish chivalry to
the gauge of such grovelling, mercantile
ideas.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the draft of troops
to Italy, the Spanish government has
ventured to decree an extensive reduction
in the army. In view of the penury
of the exchequer, of the total suppression
of the Carlist insurrection, and
of the small probability of any fresh outbreak
in a country worn out as Spain
is by civil wars and commotions, they
could not, in common decency, avoid
some such economical measure. So a
third of the army has been formed
into a reserve, which means that
the officers retain their full pay&mdash;with
the exception of those who voluntarily
exchange from the active army
into the reserve, thereby putting
themselves on half-pay&mdash;and that the
sergeants and privates, with the exception
of a skeleton staff, return to
their homes, and no longer receive
pay or rations; but are to hold themselves
in readiness, until the regular expiration
of their term of service, to join
their colours when required. From this
measure the government anticipates a
great saving, and their partisans hint a
million sterling as its probable amount.
But it is a peculiarity of Spanish administration
that the real economy of a
change of this kind can never be ascertained,
even approximatively, until
it has been for some time in force.
By a strange fatality, the most brilliant
theoretical retrenchments crumble into
dust when reduced to practice. This
has been so repeatedly the case in Spain,
that we receive such announcements
with natural distrust. In this instance,
however, it is impossible to
doubt that there will be a considerable
saving, although far less than would at
first sight be expected from the reduction,
by nearly one-third, of an army of
120,000 men. The reduction will <i>de
facto</i> be confined to the soldiers and non-commissioned
officers; for, half-pay in
Spain being a wretched pittance, and
usually many months in arrear, few
officers are likely to avail themselves of
the option afforded them. With reference
to this subject, we shall quote an
extract from a Madrid newspaper,
a strenuous opponent of the present
government, but whose statistics we
have never found otherwise than trustworthy;
and which, in this case,
would hardly venture to mis-state
facts so easy of investigation. "Calculating,"
says the <i>Clamor Publico</i> of the
30th October 1849, "that the reduction
in the active army amounts to
40,000 men, there still remain 80,000,
too great a number for a nation which
yields no more than 90,000 electors of
deputies to the Cortes; besides which
there should also be reductions in the
staff. In Spain there is a general for
every four hundred soldiers&mdash;[we believe
the <i>Clamor</i> to be mistaken, and the
proportions of generals to be even larger
than here stated;] and although we do
not possess any great magazines of
clothing, arms, ammunition and other
military stores, our army is yet the
dearest of the whole European continent,
as is proved by the following
statement. [A statement follows of
the annual cost of a soldier in the
principal Continental services, showing
the Spanish soldier to be the most
expensive of all.] From all which
we infer that the economy decreed is
by no means that required by the condition
of the treasury, and permitted
by our present state of profound peace.
The Spanish nation cannot maintain
the immense army with which it is
burdened. Retain, by all means,
the artillery, the engineers, the staff-corps,
and the other elements of war
which cannot be created at brief
notice. Keep up, on full pay, the
framework of officers necessary to
form, at two months' notice, an army
of one hundred thousand men on a war
establishment, whenever it may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_711">711</span>
necessary; but, whilst we are at peace,
restore to agriculture and the arts a
portion of the men now employed in
carrying arms." Under the regency
of Espartero, the Spanish army was
reduced to 50,000 men, and that when
the country was far less tranquil
than at present, when a Moderado
junta was plotting, at Paris, the
downfall of the government, and
Christina and Louis Philippe furnished
abundant means of corruption.
Then such an army was too small;
now it might well be deemed ample
for a country that at most contains
thirteen or fourteen millions of inhabitants,
with few fortresses to garrison,
few large towns in which to
guard against insurrection, and, above
all, with a population that would evidently
rather submit to misgovernment
than plunge again into war.
From external foes Spain has nothing
to fear; and, even if she had, we are
by no means sure that, paradoxical
as it may seem, a reduction in her
army would not be one of the best
means of guarding against them. For
retrenchments that would enable her
to acquit herself, at least in part, towards
her foreign creditors, would
assuredly procure her, in the hour of
need, friends and allies far more efficient
in her defence than her own
armies could possibly be. For however
prone the Spaniards as a
people are to exaggerate their power
and means of self-defence, it must
surely be patent to the sensible portion
of the nation that, in case of aggression
from without, they must look
for aid to France or England. And
although it will doubtless confirm the
opinion of Spanish Moderados and
French Orleanists as to the invariably
mercenary motives of Great Britain,
we will not conceal our conviction
that the readiness of this country to
succour Spain would be much greater
if she were paying her debt to English
bondholders, than if she were still in her
present state of disreputable insolvency.
At least we are quite certain that
"the pressure from without" would
be materially influenced by such a
consideration. And this reflection
naturally leads us to ask in what
position Spain would have found herself,
had the projected expedition from
the United States against Cuba taken
place and succeeded. The danger
appears at an end for the present;
but it may recur, under the rule of an
American president who will not interfere
to prevent the piratical enterprise.
As to its chances of success,
we find some striking facts whereon
to base an opinion, in a recently
published book on Cuba, the work of
an intelligent and practical man, on
whose statements and opinions we are
disposed to set a high value.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> From
Mr Madden's evidence it is quite plain
that the Spanish colonial government
is admirably calculated to excite a
desire of independence, or, failing
that, of annexation to America, in the
breasts of the people of the Havana;
and what is more, that it has already
done so, and that a body of liberators
from the States might confidently
reckon on being received with open
arms by a very considerable fraction
of the inhabitants. When the mother
country is deplorably misruled, it is not
to be expected that the dependencies
should be models of good government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In 1812," says Mr Madden, "the
constitution being proclaimed in Spain,
the whole people of the colonies were
assimilated to the inhabitants of the mother
country, with respect to representation....
In 1818, the good effects of
colonial representation were manifested
in the successful efforts of Señor Arango
with the king, Ferdinand VII., for Cuban
interests. He obtained a royal ordinance
from his majesty for the abolition of restrictions
on Cuban commerce. From this
epoch, the prosperity of the island may
be dated. Instead of being a charge to
the imperial government, it began to remit
large sums of money yearly to Spain;
instead of having authorities and troops
paid by the latter, both were henceforth
paid by Cuba. An army of 25,000 men,
sent from Spain in a miserable plight,
was maintained in Cuba, in a few years
entirely equipped and clothed, and disciplined
in the best manner, without costing
a real to the Spanish government.
From 1830, the treasury of the Havana,
in every embarrassment of the home
government, furnished Spain with means,
and was, in fact, a reserved fund for all
its pressing emergencies. When the civil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_712">712</span>
list failed Queen Christina, Cuba furnished
the means of defraying the profuse expenditure
of the palace. The contributions
arising from the island formed no small
portion, indeed, of the riches bequeathed
by Ferdinand VII. to his rapacious widow,
and to his reputed daughters."</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1841, the same writer says, Cuba
yielded a net revenue to Spain of a
million and a quarter sterling, furnished
timber and stores largely for the
Spanish navy, and entirely supported
the Spanish army in Cuba. From
the amount here stated, deductions
had to be made, or else the revenue
has diminished since that date; for Mr
Madden subsequently sums up by saying,
that "Cuba produces a revenue of
from ten to fifteen millions of dollars;
of this amount, upwards of three millions
(£600,000 sterling) are remitted
to Madrid; and these three millions of
taxes are paid by a class not exceeding
four hundred thousand inhabitants,
of free persons of all complexions."
A Spanish writer estimates the revenue,
in 1839, at eleven millions of dollars;<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and an English one, who had
good opportunities of obtaining information,
although he is sometimes rather
loose in his statements, declared,
six years later, that "Cuba contributes
fifty millions of reals, or £500,000
sterling, of clear annual revenue to
the Spanish crown."<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> From this concurrent
testimony, the sum annually
pocketed by the mother country may
be estimated at £500,000 to £600,000
sterling; an important item in the
receipts of the Madrid government&mdash;more
so, even, from its liquid and
available nature, than from its amount.
Moreover the revenues of Cuba, like
the mines of Almaden, are a ready
resource as security for a loan. But
how has Spain requited the services
of her richest colony? Of course
with gross ingratitude. Strange to
say, the equality of rights sanctioned
by the despotic Ferdinand was arbitrarily
wrenched from Cuba by the
liberal government that succeeded
him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The new Spanish constitution shut
out the colonists from the imperial representation.
This most unjust, impolitic,
and irritating measure affords a fair specimen
of the liberality and wisdom of
Spanish liberalism. It produced a feeling
of hatred against the mother country
that never before existed in Cuba. In
1836-7-8-9, [years passed by Mr Madden
in the Havana,] a general feeling
of disaffection pervaded the whole white
Creole community of Cuba. All the intelligence,
education, worth, and influence
of the white natives of the island (or
Creoles, as they are there called) was
enlisted against the government and the
sovereign of Spain, and an intense desire
for independence excited. The old rapacious
policy of Spain was renewed, of
considering every species of Cuban produce
as a commodity of a distant region,
that it was legitimate to burden with
oppressive taxes."<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, it appears that by one of those
strange absurdities which are of no
unfrequent occurrence in Spanish governments,
American settlers in Cuba
have been, and still are, exempt
from a variety of personal contributions
and other imposts, which the
natives have to pay. The laws of the
island forbid the establishment of
foreigners in Cuba; and though the
settlement of Americans has been
connived at, out of respect to the laws
the settlers were supposed, by a curious
fiction, not to exist. Hence the
exemption.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This immunity," says Mr Madden,
(p. 83,) "drew great numbers of settlers
to Cuba, from the Southern States of
America; so that some districts on the
northern shores of the island, in the vicinity,
especially, of Cardenas and Matanzas,
have more the character of American
than Spanish settlements. The prosperity
of the island has derived no small advantage
from those numerous American establishments.
Improved modes of agriculture,
of fabrication, of conveyance, were
introduced by the Americans. Several
railways have been made. In the course
of ten years, no less than ten have been
carried into effect. At the opening of the
first, from Havana to Guines, in 1837, I
was present. To American enterprise
and energy solely, I have reason to know,
this great undertaking was indebted. The
loan for it was made in England; but the
projectors, the share-jobbers, the engineer,
and the overseers, were Americans....
Cuba, ever since I knew it, has been
slowly but steadily becoming Americanised.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_713">713</span>
I pestered my superiors with my
opinions on this subject in 1836-7-8-9.
'Liberavi animam meam' might be fairly
said by me, if the star-spangled banner
were floating to-morrow on the Moro
Castle, or flaunting in the breeze at St
Iago de Cuba. In the course of seven
years a feeling, strongly prevalent in the
colony, in favour of independence, has
been changed into a desire for connexion
with the United States. It is needless
for recent political writers on Cuba to
deny the existence of a strong feeling of
animosity to the mother country, and a
longing desire for separation. From my
own intimate knowledge of these facts, I
speak of their existence. If England
could have been induced, in 1837, to guarantee
the island of Cuba from the intervention
of any foreign power, the white
inhabitants were prepared to throw off
the Spanish yoke. There was then a
Spanish army nominally of twenty thousand
men in the island, but the actual
number of native Spaniards in it did not
exceed sixteen thousand. The leading
men of the Creoles had then little apprehensions
of the result of an effort for independence.
A liberal allotment of land
in the island, for the soldiers who might
be disposed to join the independent party,
was a prospect, it was expected, which
would suffice to gain over the army....
It is not to England, now, that the white
natives of Cuba look for aid or countenance
in any future effort for independence.
It is to America that they now
turn their eyes; and America takes good
care to respond to the wishes that are
secretly expressed in those regards."</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the opinions of a man
several years resident in Cuba, evidently
a shrewd observer, and who
can hardly be suspected of misrepresentation
on this head; and we do
not hesitate to place confidence in
them in preference to the rose-tinted
accounts of the Madrid <i>Heraldo</i>, and
other official prints, according to
which the present happiness, prosperity,
and loyalty of the Havaneros
are such as were never surpassed in
the annals of colonies. Mr Madden,
we have seen, is of opinion that the
Creoles and resident Americans, if
guaranteed from foreign intervention,
are of themselves a match for Spain,
and could throw off her yoke and defy
her efforts to reimpose it. What,
then, would be the state of affairs, if
three or four thousand Yankee volunteers,
who, by themselves, we suspect,
could give occupation to all the disposable
part of the sixteen thousand
Spaniards in garrison, were suddenly
to drop upon the Cuban shore, by
preconcerted arrangement with the
disaffected? In 1849 this has been
within an ace of occurring; in a future
year, not very remote, it may actually
occur. What would Spain do, when
news were brought her that the red-and-yellow
banner was replaced by
the speckled bunting of the States?
Would she declare war against America,
on the strength of the war-steamers
she has been lately building
with her creditors' money? Brother
Jonathan, we suspect, would mightily
chuckle at the notion, and immediately
seize Puerto Rico, and perhaps make
a dash at the Philippines. But the
Spanish government, loud as they can
bluster when sure of impunity, would
hardly render themselves so ridiculous.
No; in the hour of their distress
they would piteously look abroad
for succour, and turn their discomfited
countenance to the old ally to whom,
in their brief day of seeming prosperity,
they forgot their numerous
obligations. It is our belief their appeal
would not be made in vain. But
although this country, being great and
powerful, could afford to forget its
cause of complaint&mdash;as a man overlooks
the petulance of a froward child&mdash;it
would be right and fitting that
an <i>amende honorable</i> should previously
be exacted from Spain, and that
humiliation should be inflicted on her
arrogant government, for an insult
which, let them mis-state the circumstances
as they like, was far from justified
by the alleged provocation. And
moreover, before a move was made,
or a note transmitted by the British
government on behalf of Spain-robbed-of-its-Cuba,
a solid guarantee should
unquestionably be exacted for an
equitable and speedy adjustment of
the claims of the ill-used holders of
Spanish bonds.</p>

<p>These gentlemen, roused at last by
a long series of neglect and broken
promises to depart from the <i>suaviter
in modo</i>, and to substitute an energetic
remonstrance for the honeyed and
complimentary epistles they have been
wont to address to the president of
the Spanish council, are raising a fund
to be employed in the advocacy of
their claims by an agent in Madrid.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_714">714</span>
Although the gradual progress of the
subscription does not bespeak the
fund-holders very sanguine in their
hopes, they may rest assured that this
is a step in the right direction. Their
only hope is in agitation&mdash;in keeping
their just and shamefully-neglected
claims before the world, and in such a
conjunction of circumstances as may
enable the cabinet of St James's to
put on the screw, and compel the
Spanish government to be honest.
As to an appeal to arms, however, it
might be justified in equity, and by
references to Vatel and other great
authorities, it would hardly be consonant
with prudence, or with the
spirit of the times: but other means
may be devised; and in the event of
a European war, we can imagine more
than one circumstance in which, as in
the case of the seizure of Cuba by
America, Spain would be too happy
to subscribe to the just conditions this
country might impose for the settlement
of English claims. But there is
danger in delay; and if we are unwilling
to believe that Spain is, in the
words of one who knows her well,
"irremediably insolvent,"<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> there is
no doubt she must speedily become
so, unless some radical change takes
place in the views and system of her
rulers. What she needs is an honest
government, composed of men who
will make their own advantage subservient
to their country's weal. "My
firm conviction," says Marliani, "is,
that when the day comes that men of
heart and head shall seize, with a firm
grasp, the rudder of this vessel now
abandoned to the uncertain movement
of the political waves, they will
take her into port. Spain is in the
best possible position to make a giant's
stride in the path of prosperity. She
offers to the foreigner a thousand
honourable and profitable speculations;
the application of capital to
public works, to agriculture, to mines,
will be an inexhaustible source of
profit."<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> When M. Marliani wrote
this, capitalists were more prone to
embark their money in distant speculations
than at the present day. But
still the principle holds good; and
there can be no question in the minds
of any who have studied Spain, that
an honest and moderately able government
is all that is wanted to develop
her vast resources, and enable her to
come to an honourable compromise
with her creditors, who, there can be
little doubt, would show themselves
accommodating, if they saw evidence
of a desire to pay, and had some certainty
that, when they had accepted
an arrangement advantageous to
Spain, it would not be broken in a
few months, leaving them in worse
plight than before. How this has been
repeatedly done was lately clearly
exhibited in a letter addressed by a
Spanish bondholder to the <i>Times</i>, of
which we here quote a portion:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Between 1820 and 1831, Spain contracted
loans as follows, [details given],
to the amount of 157,244,210 dollars.
And on no portion of these loans does
Spain now pay interest. In 1834 there
was owing, in interest upon those loans,
49,541,352 dollars; and the Spanish government
then offered, at the meeting of
bondholders, held at the City of London
Tavern, to give for all those loans, and the
interest upon them, new stock, on the
following terms:&mdash;A new active five per
cent stock, upon which the interest should
be always punctually paid, for two-thirds
of the capital; a new passive stock for
the remaining third; and a deferred stock
for the overdue interest, on condition that
they had a new loan of £4,000,000 sterling.
These terms were agreed to, and
the conversion took place; and there were
issued in exchange for the old loans and
overdue interest, £33,322,890 five per
cent active stock; £12,696,450 passive
stock; and £13,215,672 deferred stock.
These are the stocks now in the market,
in addition to the £4,000,000 loan then
granted. In two years after this transaction,
the Spanish government stopped
payment again, and left the bondholders
in the same situation, with one-third of
their capital cancelled, or made passive
stock, which bears no coupons, and is,
consequently, not entitled to claim interest.
In 1841, the Spanish government
paid the active bondholders four
years' interest; <i>i. e.</i>, from 1836 to 1940,
in a three per cent stock, instead of cash,
and which produced the holders about
four shillings in the pound; (this is the
three per cent stock now in the English
market, on which the interest is paid.)"<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not very easy to get at information
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_715">715</span>
about the amount of Spanish
debts, accumulated dividends, and so
forth; but the above lucid statement
of the liabilities to foreign creditors,
combined with the testimony of other
authorities before us, leads to an aggregate
estimate of the whole debt,
external and internal, at upwards of
one hundred and twenty millions sterling,&mdash;probably
at the present time
nearly or quite one hundred and
thirty millions, unpaid interest being
added. Without entering into the
intricate complications of the question,
we shall not be very wide of the
mark in asserting, that less than three
millions sterling per annum, in the
shape of dividends, would constitute
an arrangement surpassing the wildest
dreams in which, for a long time past,
sane bondholders can possibly have
indulged; in fact that, considering the
amount of passive stock, and the concessions
that would willingly be made,
it would pay what would pass muster
as the full dividends. An enormous
sum for Spain&mdash;will be the remark of
many. We beg to differ from this
opinion. An enormous sum, certainly,
for a dishonest Spanish government.
Charity begins at home in
Spain as much as anywhere; and if
people squander their cash in paying
creditors, how shall they enjoy their
little comforts and luxuries, and make
up a purse for a rainy day? How
shall the royal family of a poor and
insolvent kingdom have a civil list of
half a million sterling, besides crown
property and appanages to Infantes?&mdash;how
shall Queen Christina and her
uncle, the ex-king of the French, be
repaid the sums they lavished to oust
Espartero, and to bring about the infamous
Spanish marriages?&mdash;how
shall the same illustrious lady make
her investments in foreign funds, and
add to her hoard of jewellery, already,
it is said, the most valuable in
Europe?&mdash;how shall Duke Muñoz
play at bulls and bears on the Bolsa,
and give millions of francs for French
salt-works?&mdash;how shall the Spanish
ministers, men sprung from nothing,
and who the other day were penniless,
maintain a sumptuous state and realise
princely fortunes?&mdash;how, finally, shall
the government exercise such influence
at elections as to reduce the numerous
and powerful party opposed to them
in the country to utter numerical insignificance
in the legislative assembly,
and to fill every municipal office with
their own creatures and adherents?
It is a very singular fact that, although
for many years past the revenue
of Spain has been steadily increasing,
the annual deficit always continues
about the same. Thus much can
be discerned even through the habitual
exaggerations and hocus-pocus of
Spanish financial statements. M.
Mendizabal, in his budget for 1837, (in
the very heat and fury of the Carlist
war,) showed a deficiency of seven
millions sterling, the revenue then
being about £8,700,000 sterling. In
1840, the minister of finance stated
the deficit at £6,800,000 sterling, the
revenue having then risen to upwards
of ten millions.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> And since then the
deficiency has averaged about five
millions sterling; and even now, that
Spain is declared so prosperous, will
not be rightly stated at a much lower
figure, although finance ministers resort
to the most ingenious devices to prove
it much less. But if it is so trifling as
they would have us believe, why do
they not pay their dividends? Forced
loans, anticipated imposts, unpaid
pensions, and shabby shifts of every
kind, show us how far we are to credit
their balance-sheets. One financier&mdash;that
very slippery person, Señor Carrasco&mdash;actually
showed a surplus&mdash;upon
paper. "The present revenue,"
wrote Mr Ford in 1846, "may be
taken at about twelve or thirteen millions
sterling. But money is compared
by Spaniards to oil&mdash;a little <i>will</i> stick to
the fingers of those who measure it
out; and such is the robbing and jobbing,
the official mystification and
peculation, that it is difficult to get at
<i>facts</i> when cash is in question." The
sum stated, however, is about the
mark, and bears out Lord Clarendon's
often-quoted declaration in the House
of Lords, that the Spanish revenue is
one-half greater than it was ever before
known to be. Few men have had
better opportunities than Lord Clarendon
of acquiring information on the
affairs of Spain; and his well-known
friendly feeling towards her present
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_716">716</span>
rulers precludes the suspicion of his
giving a higher colouring than the
strictest truth demands to any statement
likely to be prejudicial or unpleasant
to them. It is a fact that the
revenue is still upon the increase; and
it has augmented, in the last fifteen
years, by more than one-half, for
in 1835 it was but seven hundred
and fifty-nine millions of reals, or, in
round numbers, £7,600,000 sterling. It
certainly seems strange that, with an
increase of revenue of at least four
millions, the decrease of deficit should
barely amount to two, although the
country, at the former period, was
plunged in a most expensive war, and
had an enormous army on foot; the
estimate for the war department alone,
for 1837&mdash;according to Mr Mendizabal's
budget already quoted, presented to
the Cortes&mdash;being upwards of seven
and a-half millions sterling, <i>or within
one million of the total amount of estimated
revenue</i>. Thus we see that Spain
presents the curious phenomenon of an
expenditure augmenting in proportion
as the revenue increases. In most
countries the puzzle is the other way;
and how, to force the revenue up to the
expenditure, is the knotty point with
statesmen. The most benevolent can
hardly help suspecting that some foul
play is at the bottom of this augmentative
propensity of Spanish financial
outgoings. But Spain is <i>par excellence</i>
the country of itching palms;
and in view of the statements we
have here made, and which defy refutation,
most persons will probably
agree with a writer already cited, when
he says that, "with common sense
and common honesty, much might be
done towards releasing Spain from her
financial embarrassments. Perhaps
it is not too much to say, that a vigorous
government, capable of enforcing
taxation, might, with integrity and
energy, and a forgetfulness of selfish
gains, provide for the interest of every
portion of her debt, and, in the
end, pay off the principal....
If Spanish finance ministers, and the
capitalists and sharpers by whom
they are surrounded, could bring
themselves to think of their own fortunes
less and of the nation's more,
we should hear very little of new foreign
loans. A virtuous native effort
is wanted; themselves must strike
the blow! All governments are bound
to support their several departments,
and obtain a sufficient revenue; and
the administration of Mon and Narvaez
has not the excuse of want of
power."<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> This is the language universally
held by all persons acquainted,
from actual observation, with the
extent and abuse of Spain's resources.
The taxes in Spain are exceedingly
light in proportion to the population,
but they are unfairly distributed, and
most iniquitously collected&mdash;the state
paying an enormous percentage on
most of them, and being besides
scandalously robbed by officials of
every grade. But the inequality of
taxation in Spain, which presses (by
the threefold means of direct impost,
excise, and exorbitant import duties
upon manufactures) especially on the
peasant and agriculturist&mdash;crushing
the very nerve and right arm of Spanish
prosperity&mdash;brings us to the consideration
of a recent measure, from
which much good has been predicted,
and from which, as we trust and believe,
advantage will ultimately be obtained.</p>

<p>An ably conducted French periodical,
which acquired considerable
weight under Louis Philippe, from the
circumstance that its closing article
expressed, every fifteen days, the
views and opinions of the government,
and which, since it ceased to be
official, has shown a strong Orleanist
leaning, put forth in a recent number
a glowing statement of the immense
advantages to be derived by
Spain from the newly promulgated
tariff bill.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Prepared by a previous
article in the same review, which had
taken for its base, and accepted as incontrovertible,
a tissue of scurrilous
and mendacious statements strung
together by a Salamanquino doctor,
and notoriously instigated by a Spanish
minister and ambassador, with
reference to the suspension of relations
between England and Spain, we were
no way surprised to find, in the discussion
of the internal situation of the
latter country, implicit reliance placed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">717</span>
on the figures and assumptions of
Spanish financiers, and a most <i>naïve</i>
conviction that their showy theories
and projects would be honestly and
effectually put in practice. Under
the ingenious one-sidedness and apparent
good faith of the writer, it was
not difficult to discern an inspiration
derived from Claremont or the Hotel
Sotomayor. The object of the article
was to prove that Spain, relieved from
the incubus of English influence, and
blessed with an enlightened and honest
government, is rapidly emerging
from her political, social, and financial
difficulties; nay, that this astounding
progress is half accomplished, and
that the despised land has already
risen many cubits in the European
scale. "We ask," says the writer,
after summing up at great length the
benefits conferred on Spain by the
Narvaez cabinet&mdash;benefits which, for
the most part, have got no further
than their project upon paper&mdash;"We
ask, is not Spain sufficiently revenged
for thirty years of disdain? Would
not this Job of the nations have a
right, in its turn, to drop insult upon
the bloody dunghill whereon display
themselves these haughty civilisations
of yesterday's date?" Having given
this brief specimen of style, we will
now confine ourselves to figures,
for most of which the writer in the
<i>Revue</i> appears to be indebted to Mr
Mon. The result of his very plausible
calculations is an immediate
annual benefit of thirty-four million
francs to the consumers of foreign
manufactures, ninety-two millions to
the country at large, in the shape of
increased production, and a clear gain
of sixty-three millions to the public
treasury. We heartily desire, for the
sake both of Spain and of her creditors,
that this glorious prospect may
be realised. If this is to be the result
of what the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>
admits to be but a timid step from the
prohibitive to the protective system,
what prosperity may not be prophesied
to Spain from further progress in
the same path? Nor are these a tithe
of the benefits foretold, and which
we refuse ourselves the pleasure
of citing, in order to make room for
a few remarks as to the probable
realisation of those already referred
to. And first, we repeat our previous
assertion, that in Spain the real benefit
of such a measure as the new tariff
can never be rightly estimated till
the law has been for some time in
force. There is so much tampering
and corruption in such cases, so many
interests and persons must be satisfied
and get their share of the gain,
that such reforms, when they come,
often prove very illusory. With respect
to the tariff, we will take no
heed of the statements of the Spanish
opposition, who denounce it as a most
defective and bungling measure, from
which little is to be expected. In
Spain, as much as in any country,
the men out of power will admit little
good to be done by those who are in.
Neither do we profess to have digested
and formed our own opinion upon the
probable working of a tariff which
comprises 1500 articles, (about twice
and a half as many as the British
tariff,) and whose complications and
conditions are anything but favourable
to its easy comprehension and appreciation.
We can argue, therefore,
only from analogy and precedent; the
latter, especially, no unsafe guide with
a people so wedded as the Spaniards
to old habits and institutions. The
pacific manner in which the great
army of Spanish smugglers have received
the tariff, is a strong argument
against its practical value. The
<i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> estimates the
number of smugglers in Spain at sixty
thousand. This is far under the
mark; and it is the first time we have
known the Spanish smugglers to be
reckoned at less than one hundred and
twenty thousand men, whereas we
have seen them rated as high as four
hundred thousand, which, however,
could only be explained by including
all those persons in the country who
are directly or indirectly connected
with the contraband trade. But the
figure is not important. The principal
point, and that which none will dispute,
is that the Peninsular smugglers form
a powerful army, including the finest
men in the country, and capable, as
we fully believe, if assembled and with
the advantage of a little drill, of
soundly thrashing an equal number of
Spanish soldiers, detachments of whom
they not unfrequently do grievously
ill-treat. Now how is it, we ask, that
this formidable and generally turbulent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">718</span>
body have submitted without an indication
of revolt to the passing of a
law which, if the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> is right, will entirely take
away their occupation? The self-styled
manufacturers of Catalonia,
most of whom are extensive
smugglers, are as acute judges of
their own interests as any men in
Spain. In Andalusia, on the Portuguese
frontier, in nearly every frontier
province in short, men of wealth,
ability, and consideration are at the
head of the contraband traffic. It is
not to be supposed that all these have
their eyes shut to the meditated destruction
of their interests, or that
they thus tranquilly receive a blow
which they believe will be fatal. It
will be remembered by many that
when first the new tariff was seriously
brought forward, and appeared
likely to become the law of the land,
the Catalan newspapers and other
organs of the smuggling interest were
furious in their denunciation of it:
alarming rumours were set abroad,
insurrections were talked of, and there
seemed a very pretty chance of a
<i>pronunciamiento</i> in favour of prohibitive
duties and contraband trade.
But suddenly modifications were
talked of, the publication of the bill
was postponed, the storm was allayed
and has not again arisen. There was
something so remarkable in this sudden
stilling of the troubled waters, that
persons, who are either very malicious
or better versed than their neighbours
in the ways of Spain, did not scruple
to assert that there had been buying
and selling, that weighty arguments
had been advanced and had prevailed,
and that the result was to be the
emasculation of the tariff bill. No
trifling consideration would suffice to
clench such a bargain, and doubtless
the concession, if obtained, was well
paid for; but what of that? The
trade of a smuggler is the most profitable
in Spain, excepting, perhaps,
that of a cabinet minister; and it was
worth a sacrifice to retain a traffic
whose profits, the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> assures us, range from 60 to
90 per cent on the value of the cotton
tissues introduced, and a lower percentage
on silks, woollens, and other
goods, of greater value in proportion
to their bulk, weight, and difficulty of
transport. For this percentage, the
master-smuggler receives the goods
without the frontier, and delivers them
within, supporting all charges, and
running all risks: it is a premium of
insurance, as regularly fixed as that
of any marine risk at Lloyd's. But
does the <i>Revue</i> suppose that the present
very high charge for passage will
not be materially reduced, sooner than
altogether relinquished? Spanish
smuggling requires capital and stability,
on the part of those undertaking
it on a large scale, and is a sort of
monopoly in the hands of a certain
number of individuals and companies.
These pay the working smugglers (the
men who lift the bales, and drive the
mules, and fight the custom-house
officers) a few reals a-day, a few
dollars a <i>run</i>, and pocket enormous
profits. Amongst themselves, they
are leagued to maintain the high rates
of insurance. But now that the custom-house
steps into the field as a
competitor, removing prohibition and
lowering duties, we may be well assured
the smugglers have lowered
theirs; and an inquiry at Perpignan,
Oléron, Mauléon, on the Five Cantons
at Bayonne, or in any other
smuggling depot on the Pyrenean
frontier, would, we doubt not, satisfy
the <i>Revue</i> of the fact. The Spanish
custom-house must cut lower yet to
beat the smuggler. The <i>Revue</i> admits
that, on certain articles of great
consumption, (silk,) the difference is
still in favour of the contrabandist,
even at the duty of thirty to forty-five
per cent <i>ad valorem</i>, fixed by
the tariff bill, and at the old high premium
of smuggling insurance. But
whilst we insist and are confident
that the latter will be reduced, (and
therein find one reason of the tranquil
indifference with which the tariff has
been received by the smuggling population
of the Peninsula,) we are by no
means certain that the former has not
been considerably raised by the alterations
and modifications that took
place in the tariff, between the date of
its passing the chambers and that of
its publication by the government;
alterations by which the <i>ad valorem</i>
duties imposed on several important
classes of merchandise have been converted
into fixed duties. This change,
which may very well prove a juggle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">719</span>
brought about by the golden wand of
the smuggling fraternity, at once invalidates
the calculations of the <i>Revue</i>,
which are all based upon the <i>ad
valorem</i> percentage originally prescribed
by the tariff law, and upon
the assumption that the high contraband
premiums are immutable and
unreducible.</p>

<p>Setting aside the mere financial
consideration of the tariff question;
losing sight, for a while, of the great
accession of revenue it is universally
admitted that Spain would derive from
an honest and effectual reduction of
her import-duties on manufactures,
which she herself can produce only of
inferior quality and at exorbitant
rates; losing sight, also, of the moral
obligation there is upon her to adopt
all such measures, not injurious to
any great class of the community,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
as shall enable her to pay her way,
and acquit her debts to home and
foreign creditors,&mdash;temporarily averting
our view, we say, from these
considerations, we fix it upon others
whose weight none will deny. What
are the chief causes to which the
major part of the crime, misery, and
degradation prevalent amongst the
lower classes in Spain, is attributed,
by all impartial observers of her social
condition? They are three in number.
The demoralisation produced by
smuggling; the burdens upon agriculture,
and impediments to its progress;
the high prices the peasant is
compelled to pay for the most necessary
manufactures. Upon the evil of
smuggling we need not dwell, nor
dilate upon the ease of the transition
from defrauding the government
to robbing upon the highway, and
from shooting a <i>douanier</i> to murdering
the traveller who may be so rash
as to defend his purse. By the lower
classes in Spain the smuggler is admired
and respected, and his calling
is deemed gallant and honourable;
by the classes above him he is tolerated,
and often employed. His random,
perilous, fly-by-night manner of
life, made up of alternate periods of
violent exertion and excitement, and
perfect idleness and relaxation, exactly
suits his taste and temperament:
it will be hard to wean him from his
illicit pursuits, though they should so
decline in profit as only to yield him
bread, garlic, and tobacco. You
must find him occupation profitable
and to his taste before you can
reclaim him; for he will not dig,
and would rather rob than beg.
Whenever such import-duties are
adopted in Spain as will really stop
smuggling, there will undoubtedly be
a great increase of crimes against
property, innumerable bands of robbers
will spring up, and probably
there will also be risings under political
banners. The present moment
is by no means unpropitious for the
experiment. The government of
Spain has perhaps the power, but we
doubt that it has the will. We have
shown cause for believing that the
recent change will prove delusive, and
of small benefit. If we are mistaken&mdash;and
it is very difficult to decide
beforehand of the result of Spanish
measures&mdash;we shall sincerely rejoice.</p>

<p>We have already observed that,
whilst the brunt of taxation is borne
in Spain by agriculture, that interest
obtains in return scarcely any of the
facilities and encouragements to which
it is fairly entitled. Spain is the rash
child that would run before it can
walk, and consequently falls upon its
face. She dashes headlong at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_720">720</span>
greatest and most costly improvements
realised by other countries;
forgetting that she has stood still
whilst they moved onwards, and that
a wise man gets a bed to lie upon
before troubling himself about a silken
coverlet. In all the arts of life Spain
is immeasurably inferior to most other
European nations. In agricultural
implements, in carts and other
vehicles of transport, in her methods
of elaborating her products, and her
means of carrying them, she is centuries
behind all the world. Vast
tracts of her territory are desolate for
want of that irrigation for which modern
ingenuity and invention have
devised such great facilities: the
broad waters of her mighty rivers,
which in other countries would be
alive with traffic and bordered with
villages, are choked and desolate.
"The Guadalquivir, navigable in the
time of the Romans as far as Cordova,
is now scarcely practicable for sailing
vessels of a moderate size up to
Seville."<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Few are the boats, scanty
the dwellings, upon the green waves
and flower-grown shores of Tagus and
Ebro. When these glorious natural
arteries are thus neglected, we need not
expect artificial ones. Canals are sadly
wanted, and have been often planned,
but they have got no farther than the
want and the project. As to roads,
the main lines are good, but they are
few, diverging from the capital to the
various frontiers; and the cross-roads
(where there are any,) and the country
tracks, are mostly execrable, and
often impassable for wheels. But all
this, we are informed by the <i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, is on the eve of a
thorough change. "Labour, like
credit," says that periodical, in its
article on Spain, "has received a
beneficial impulse. The roads are
repaired, the means of water-conveyance
are being improved or terminated,
railroads are begun. The creation
of a vast system (<i>ensemble</i>) of adjacent
roads will soon connect all parts
of the territory with these vivifying
arteries." We scarcely know which
is most admirable; the cleverness that
contrives to condense so many misstatements
into so few words, or this
tone of candour, conviction, and philanthropical
exultation. As regards
the impulse given to Spanish credit,
it is but a few days since we read,
with some astonishment at the barbarity
and impudence of the plan (emanating
though it does from a Spanish
finance minister), the arrangement by
which Mr Bravo Murillo, in order to
diminish the acknowledged deficit in
the budget for the year 1850, mulcts
the army and state functionaries of a
month's pay, and pensioners and half-pay
men of two months' means of
subsistence, besides wiping out, in a
still more unceremonious manner,
other pressing claims upon the treasury.
The budget itself is a truly curious
document. The customs' revenue
is swollen by the supposed profits
of the new tariff; the expenses of the
war department are boldly set down at
a reduction which must accord rather
with Mr Murillo's wish than with his
expectations. On the debit side figure
also the claims of the public creditor,
for much less than is due, certainly, but
for far more than will be paid. The
result of the estimate is, as usual, most
satisfactory, or would be so, at least,
if there were the slightest chance of
its justification by the actual receipts
and expenditure of the year for which
it is made. To return, however, to
the improvements and public works
announced by the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i>. We certainly find in the
budget a sum of about three hundred
thousand pounds&mdash;something more
than half the involuntary contribution
wrung from the unhappy <i>employés</i> and
pensioners&mdash;set down to roads, railways,
and canals. Is this magnificent
sum to complete the valuable water-communications
and the network of
roads promised to expectant Spain?
Hardly, even if applied as appropriated,
which little enough of it
ever will be. As to railways, they
are certainly <i>begun</i>, but that is as
much as can be said. There is a
thirty mile railroad open between Barcelona
and Mataro, upon which accidents
seem of pretty frequent occurrence;
and that said, we have said
all. A good many others have been
planned, involving the most magnificent
projects of tunnels through
chains of mountains, viaducts over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_721">721</span>
great rivers, cuttings through dense
forests, and the like; and at some of
these there may be attempts at work,
enough to justify demands for funds;
but their termination is altogether another
matter in a country where,
according to its national proverb,
things are begun late, and never
finished. Doubtless it is a satisfaction
to Spanish pride, when it sees
other European countries veined with
iron tracks, to be able to talk of
Spanish railroads as things that are
not only projected, but begun. A
great country like Spain must not lag
behind in the race of improvement,
and its natives would deem themselves
humiliated if they did not attempt to
have what England, France, and Germany
enjoy. Nothing can escape
these ambitious hidalgos. They have
heard of the electric telegraph, and it
is easy to discern, by newspaper paragraphs,
that they are agog for the
novelty, although the country has just
been put to considerable expense by
the completion and improvement of
the aërial semaphores. These work
very well, the <i>Diario Mercantil</i> of
Valencia told us the other day; but
fogs are a great nuisance, the electric
plan is much better and surer, and
a German company has offered to lay
any length of wires at the rate of two
hundred pounds sterling per league;
and the <i>Diario</i> trusts the government
will keep the matter in view, and
adopt the new system, if it can be
done without obstacles arising from
political disturbances, and from the
ignorance and malevolence of the
people. If the electric telegraph were to
await the completion of the "vivifying
arteries" of railroad promised by the
more sanguine friends of Spain, the
German company would do well to
offer its services elsewhere; but evidently
there is some notion of carrying
the posts and wires across country,
over sierras and <i>despoblados</i>,
with boards, no doubt, affixed here
and there, requesting the public, to
"protect the telegraph." How long the
posts would stand&mdash;how long the wires
might escape injury from the superstitious
peasantry, or from robbers and
smugglers, interested in retarding the
transmission of their misdeeds, is another
question. Really, to use a popular
comparison, the establishment
of electric telegraphs on Spanish soil
seems to us about as necessary and
sensible as to affix a gilt handle to
the door of a pig-stye. Not that we
would, in any way, assimilate to
the unclean beast our friends the
Spaniards, whom we greatly esteem,
and desire to see more prosperous:
but thus it is with them ever. They
would fain pass over the rudiments,
and attain at a bound that height of
civilisation which other nations have
reached only by a toilsome and patient
progress.</p>

<p>The dearness of most manufactured
goods in Spain, and especially of the
commonest and, as Englishmen would
consider, most essential articles of
clothing, is, we are fully convinced, a
grave impediment to the moral and
physical progress of the lower classes
of Spaniards. If, quitting certain
frontier districts, where smuggling
gains diffuse a fallacious appearance
of prosperity, we penetrate into the
interior of the country, we behold a
rural population sunk in filth and
sloth, wrapped in squalid woollen
rags, basking listlessly in the sun,
dwelling oftentimes in community
with their domestic animals. Yet,
give him but the means, and no
man more than this self-same Spanish
peasant loves clean linen and neat
attire. If he is dirty and shirtless,
and afflicted with vermin and impurities,
it is because he has never had
the means of being otherwise. How
can he, out of his scanty earnings,
supply himself with the calico shirt
and clean jacket of jean or flannel
which, in the countries of their manufacture,
are within the reach of the
poorest labourer, but whose price is
trebled, before they reach him in
Spain, by exorbitant smuggling premiums
or import-duty, and by an
expensive and defective system of
transport. We cannot agree with
those who assert the Spaniard of the
lower class to be a born idler, who
will never willingly do more work
than procures him the day's frugal
meal. We have too great faith in his
natural good qualities to receive this
opinion otherwise than as a calumny.
At any rate, before deciding thus
harshly, give him a chance, which he
has never yet had; show him the
possibility, which he has never yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">722</span>
seen, of attaining, by his own exertions,
to comfort and respectability;
put the necessaries of life within his
reach, which they have never yet
been, and spur him, with his own
pride, to cleanliness and industry.
Teach him, in short, self-respect,
which he can hardly feel in his
present sunken condition, and, rely
upon it, he will make an effort and
take a start.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to dwell upon
the recent temporary displacement
of the Narvaez ministry, at the very
moment when its stability and power
seemed most assured, when the exultation
of its partisans was the loudest,
and the subjection of the nation
most complete. The singular manner
of the change, the ignoble agents by
whom it was immediately effected,
the obscurity and inaptitude of the
individuals who for a moment made
their apparition at the helm, to be at
the next thrown overboard; the
strangely heedless and inconsistent
conduct of the young Queen, and the
ambiguous attitude of her mother,
have found abundant commentators,
and the whole episode has been wittily
and not unjustly compared to one of
those old Spanish comedies based on
a palace intrigue. We cannot, however,
admit that the entire glory of
the curious and abortive plot belongs
to the apostolical <i>camarilla</i> which is
alleged to exist in the palace, and to
consist, amongst others, of the feeble
and bigoted king-consort, of a fanatical
confessor, a hysterical nun, a
jesuitical secretary, and others of similar
stamp. Time will probably dissipate
part of the mystery that now
envelops the affair; but, even now,
those accustomed to watch the show
will have shrewd suspicious whose are
the hands that pulled the wires and
made the dull puppets dance. The
hands showed little skill, it will perhaps
be urged, in the selection and
man&oelig;uvring of the dolls. This objection
will hardly stand. When a
juggler misses his trick, it is still
something if he hides his arm from
his audience. And as to the incapacity
of the agents, they were probably
not employed until others, abler but
less docile, had refused to act. We
entertain little doubt in what quarter
the attempt was fostered&mdash;perhaps
concerted. Notwithstanding the outward
cordiality of the French and
Spanish governments, it is notorious
that the old alliance between Queen
Christina and a lately deposed monarch
still exists, for the attainment of
objects dear to both their hearts. In
what manner these objects were to be
advanced by the recent shuffle of the
Spanish political cards, is not at first
sight apparent. But we entertain
scarcely the shadow of a doubt, that
the arch-plotter whose influence has
more than once wrought evil to Spain,
had a hand in the game. We would
be the last to press hardly upon the
fallen. Did we feel tempted so to do,
we should truly feel ourselves rebuked
by the noble example of that illustrious
Lady, who has forgotten the treachery
of the king in the sorrows of the exile,
and has extended that sympathy and
kindness to the dweller in the English
cottage, which she could not have
been expected again to show to the
inmate of the French palace. We are
guarded, then, in the expression of our
regret, that one who, by the pursuit
of purely personal objects, has been
the cause of great calamities to his
native land, should still indulge his
dynastic ambition at the expense of
the tranquillity of another country,
previously indebted to him for much
discord and misery. And we deem it
a painful sight when a man whose
years already exceed the average span
of human existence is still engrossed
by plans of unscrupulous aggrandisement,
still busied with Machiavelian
intrigues, still absorbed in the baser
things of earth, instead of addressing
himself to considerations of higher
import, earning by his virtues in adversity
that respect refused to his
conduct in prosperity, and passing the
last days of his life&mdash;the posthumous
ones of his royalty&mdash;resigned, revered,
and beloved, like one who preceded
him on his throne and in his banishment,
and whose name was on his
lips in the hour of his fall.

<h2 id="THE_GREEN_HAND">THE GREEN HAND.<br />

<small>A "SHORT" YARN.&mdash;PART VI.</small></h2>

<p>"Well, ma'am," continued the
naval man, on again resuming his
narrative, "as I told you, the sudden
hail of  'Land!' brought us all on deck
in a twinkling, in the midst of my
ticklish conversation with the Judge."
"Hallo! you aloft!" shouted the chief
officer himself, "d'ye hear, sirrah! use
your eyes before hailing the deck!"
"Land, sir!" came falling down again
out of the sunlight; "land it is, sir,&mdash;broad
away on our larboard bow,
sir."</p>

<p>By this time it was about half-past
nine, or ten o'clock, of the morning.
Heading nearly due south-east, as we
now were, the Indiaman's bowsprit
ran up into the full white blaze of light,
in which her flying jib-boom seemed
to quiver and writhe far away from
her like an eel in water; while the
spread of her sails against it loomed
twice as large as ordinary, from the
sort of hazy double-edged look they
had, with a twinkling thread of sun
drawing all round them like a frame,
as if one saw through a wrong-screwed
glass. You'd have thought by the
glance under the fore-course, over the
ship's head-gratings, she was travelling
off quietly into some no-man's-land
or other, where it would be so
bright we should all have to wear
green spectacles: the light breeze
being almost direct from nor'west, and
so fairly in her favour, with the help
of her studding-sails she was making
wonderful progress for such a mere
breath&mdash;about four knots to the hour,
as I reckoned. The air aloft appeared
in the mean time to be steadying and
sucking, though the water kept smooth,
and her bows scarce made a noise in
it: the wide soft swells of the sea just
floated up of a pale blue, and lifted her
on, till she went seething gently down
into it again; only, if you put your
head over the starboard side, and
listened, you thought you heard a sort
of dull poppling ripple coming along
the bends from round her counter.
As for the line of horizon on one bow
or the other, 'twas hardly to be made
out at all, with a streaky white haze
overlying it, up in the sky as it were,
on both sides, behind the dazzle of
light. However, the passengers were
fancying all kinds of fine tropical
matters lay hidden thereaway; and
in fact, what with the notion of land
after a long voyage, and what with
the faint specks of bright cloud that
seemed to be melting far off in the
glare&mdash;to anyone last from Gravesend,
that had never seen anything stranger
than Richmond Hill of a Sunday, the
whole thing ahead of the ship would
have rather an enchanted sort of a look.
At length the third mate was seen to
shove his spy-glass together in the top-gallant
cross-trees, and came slowly
down the rigging. "Well, Mr Rickett?"
said the chief officer, meeting
him as he landed on deck. "Well,
sir," said Rickett, "it <i>is</i> land after all,
Mr Finch!" The mate rapped out
an oath, and took another turn:
Macleod screwed his mouth as if he
were going to whistle, then pulled his
red whiskers instead, and looked queer
at Rickett; while Rickett stood peering
into his spy-glass as he would have
done into his hat, had he still been a
foremast-man. The mate's eye met
his, then turned to the passengers leaning
over the poop-railing; and they all
three walked to the capstan, where
they began to overhaul the charts, and
laid their heads together out of earshot.</p>

<p>Now, whether this said land just
made out on the north-east, trended
away back to south-east, as the
clearer look of the horizon to starboard
made one think, it was hard to
say&mdash;though in <i>that</i> way of it, there
were <i>seemingly</i> two plans for widening
her distance. Either Finch might
think it better to keep hold of a fair
wind, and just edge her off enough to
drop the point on her weather quarter&mdash;when,
of course, if things stood
as they were, we should soon set a
good stretch of water betwixt us and
the coast; or else they might brace
direct round on the other tack, and
head right south-west'ard, out to sea
again: though if we were still <i>in</i> it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">724</span>
the current would set us every bit as
much in its own direction as ever. Accordingly
I sidled nearer to the capstan,
and watched anxiously for what the
third mate had to propose, after humming
and hawing a little, and scratching
his head under his cap for half a minute.
"At any rate, Mr Finch, sir,"
said he, "more especially the captain
being off charge, I may say, why, I'd
advise ye, sir, to &mdash;&mdash;." Here he
dropped his voice; but Finch apparently
agreed to what he said.</p>

<p>"Ready about ship there!" said the
second mate aloud to the boatswain
forward; and in ten minutes afterwards
the Seringapatam was fairly round, as I
had expected, heading at a right angle
to her former course, with the breeze
before her starboard beam, and the
sun blazing on the other. I walked
forward to the bows, and actually
started to hear how loud and clear the
ripple had got under them of a sudden;
meeting her with a plash, as if she
were making six or seven knots headway,
while the canvass seemed to
draw so much stiffer aloft, you'd have
supposed the breeze had freshened as
soon as the helm was put down. The
mates looked over the side and aloft,
rubbing their hands and smiling to
each other, as much as to say how
fast she was hauling off the bad neighbourhood
she was in, though the heat
was as great as ever, and you didn't
feel a breath more air below, nor see
the water ruffle. To <i>my</i> notion, in
fact, it was just the set of the current
against her that seemingly freshened
her way, the ship being now direct in
its teeth; so that, of course, it would
keep bearing her up all the time away
north-eastward, with her own leeway
to help it; and the less could any one
notice the difference betwixt the water
going past her side, and <i>her</i> passing
the water. This tack of hers, which
Rickett, no doubt, thought such a safe
plan, might be the very one to put her
in a really dangerous way yet; for
when they did discover this under-tow,
how were they to take her out of it,
after all? Probably by trying to
stand fair across the stream of it to
southward, which, without three times
the wind we had, would at best take
us out many miles nearer the land it
set upon, or leave us perhaps becalmed
in the midst of it.</p>

<p>The truth was, that although I
hadn't seen what like the land was,
and couldn't have said, by the chart,
<i>where</i> we were, I began to have a faint
notion of whereabouts we possibly
soon might be, from what I remembered
hearing an old quartermaster in
the Iris say, a couple of years before,
regarding a particular spot on the
south-west coast, where the currents at
some seasons, as he phrased it, made a
regular race-course meeting. The old
fellow gave me also, at the time, some
bearings of the nearest coast, with the
landmarks at the mouth of a river a
little farther north&mdash;which, he said, he
would know if you set him down there
of a dark night, though he had been
in his bed at Gosport the minute before,
if there was just a right streak
of sky to the eastward&mdash;namely, a big
black rock like two steps, and a block
at the foot of them, somewhat the
shape of a chipped holy-stone, running
down on one side out of a high
headland, like an admiral's cocked
hat, with six mop-headed trees upon
the root of the rock, for all the
world like hairs on a wart. Here I
recollected how my worthy authority
pointed modestly for example to a
case of the kind on his own nose.
The opposite shore of its mouth was
flat, with a heavy white surf; but it
shut in so far upon the other, he said,
that, steering from the south'ard, one
would never know there was a river
there at all. The Bambar he called
it; but if he meant the Bembarooghe,
we could scarcely be near <i>it</i>, or that
much toward being abreast of St Helena.
For all I saw, indeed, we might
have nothing to eastward of us save
a hard coast, or else the sandy coast
farther down, shoaling out of sight of
land! At any rate I knew we must
have got into the tail of the great sea-stream
from round the Cape of Good
Hope, which would, no doubt, split out
at sea on Viana's Bank, and turn partly
to north-eastward thereabouts; so
that it wasn't a very bad guess to
suppose we were getting up somewhere
near Cape Frio, the likeliest
place in the world to find old Bob
Martin's "maze," which we used to
joke about so in the Iris.</p>

<p>What was done, though, required
to be done quickly, and I looked about
for Tom Westwood, till I saw him on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_725">725</span>
the poop amongst the rest, talking
again to Miss Hyde, as they all crowded
towards the lee-quarter to watch
the land-haze seemingly dropping
stern. My heart swelled as it were
into my throat, however, at such an
appearance of good understanding betwixt
the two,&mdash;whereas there was
<i>she</i>, an hour ago that very morning,
would scarce favour me with a look
or a word!&mdash;and, for the life of me, I
couldn't have spoken to Westwood at
the time, much less gone hand in
hand; for that matter, he didn't seem
to be suspecting aught wrong to
trouble himself about. What to say
or do, either, I couldn't think; since
the more he cut me out, and the less
friendly I felt to him, the less could I
risk the chance of showing us both up
for what we <i>were</i>,&mdash;which, of course,
would bring him in for the worst of
it; as if <i>I</i>, by Jove, were, going to
serve him some low trick for the sake
of shoving <i>him</i> out with the young
lady. Meantime I kept fidgeting
about, as if the deck were too hot for
me, snatching a glance now and then,
in spite of myself, at Violet Hyde's
fairy-like figure; so different from
the rest of them, as she stretched
eagerly from below the awning over
the ship's quarter-gallery, trying to
make out where the land lay,&mdash;now
putting her little hand over her eyes
to see better, then covering them altogether
from the dazzle, as she drew
in her head again and shook her bright
brown hair in the shadow, answering
Westwood&mdash;confound him! The Indian
servant each time carefully poking
out the red and yellow punkah-fringe
for a cover over her, while the
passengers were one and all ready to
cry at not seeing the land, and leaving
it behind. The Judge himself
was the only man that seemed to have
a dim notion of something queer in
the whole case; for every few minutes
he walked quietly to the break of the
poop, where I noticed him cast a
doubtful look down upon the "chief
officer;" and when the surgeon came
up, he asked anxiously how Captain
Williamson was, and if he couldn't be
seen below. However, the surgeon
told him the captain had just fallen
for the first time into a good sleep,
and there was no admittance, but
he was likely to be much better soon.</p>

<p>By this time there was no standing
out from under the awnings, and the
quarterdeck and poop had to be well
swabbed to keep them at all cool, the
steam of it rising inside with a pitchy
hempen sort of smell you never feel
save in the Tropics; the Seringapatam
still feeling the breeze aloft, and lifting
on the water with a ripple forward,
although her big courses went lapping
fore and aft every time she swung.
The long white haze on the horizon
began to melt as the sun heightened,
clearing from under the wake of the
light, till now you could fairly see the
sky to eastward. Near noon, in fact,
we had almost dropped the haze altogether
on the ship's quarter; and at
first I was glad to see how much way
she had made in the two hours, when,
on second thoughts, and by noticing
some marks in the loom of it, I had
no doubt but though she might be
farther off, why it was only while she
set more up to north-eastward,&mdash;so
that we were actually, so to speak,
leaving it by getting nearer! However,
as the men were at dinner, and
most of the passengers gone off the
poop, down to "tiffin," I made up my
mind to try what I could do in a quiet
way towards making the mate think
of it more seriously.</p>

<p>"Ah," said I, in a would-be brisk
and confidential kind of way, "glad
we're leaving that&mdash;a&mdash;you know, that
land, Mr Finch." "Indeed, sir," said
he indifferently. "Oh, you know,"
said I, "it's all very well for the <i>passengers</i>
there to talk fine about land&mdash;land&mdash;but
you and I, Mr Finch, don't need
to be told that it's always dangerous
at sea, you know." The mate lifted
his head and eyed me for a moment
or two, between the disgust a sailor
feels at seeing a fellow pretend to
aught like seamanship, and a particular
sort of spite toward me which
I'd noticed growing in him for the
last few days,&mdash;though I daresay my
breakfasting that morning in Sir
Charles's cabin might have brought it
to a height.</p>

<p>"Land dangerous, sir!" answered
he carelessly, as he went on wiping
his quadrant again; "who put <i>that</i>
into your head?" "Oh, well," returned
I, just as carelessly, "if it's to
leeward of course,&mdash;or with a current
taking you towards it,&mdash;only then.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_726">726</span>
But I've no doubt, Mr Finch, if this
wind <i>were</i> to&mdash;ah&mdash;you know, heave
more abaft, that's to say, get stronger,
the craft would at least stand still,
till you got her&mdash;" "What on
earth <i>are</i> you talking about, Mr
Ford&mdash;Collins, I mean?" asked he
sharply. "Really, sir, I've got something
more to attend to at present,
than such trash about a current, and
the devil knows what else!" "How,
why, Mr Finch!" said I, seemingly
surprised in my turn, "<i>are</i> we not in
a current just now, then?" "Current!"
replied Finch, almost laughing
outright, "what <i>does</i> the man
mean?" "Why every one thinks
so, in the cuddy," said I, as if rather
taken aback, and venturing what
you fair ladies call a 'fib,'&mdash;"ever
since we picked up the bottle last
night." This, by the bye, had got
spread through some of the men to
the passengers, though, of course,
nobody knew what had been in it
yet. "<i>There</i>, I declare now," continued
I, pointing to our lee-bow,
where I'd had my eyes fixed during
the five minutes we spoke, "we can
try it again; do you see that bird
yonder on the water?" The mate
turned his head impatiently, and
"Look, watch him, sir," said I. This
was a tired man-o'-war bird afloat
about twenty fathoms off, with its
sharp white wings stretched just
clear of the water, and its black eye
sparkling in the sunlight, as it came
dipping on the long smooth hot-blue
swell into the lee of the ship's lofty
hull, till you saw its very shadow in
the glitter below it. The Indiaman
seemed to pass him as if he rode
there at anchor; only the curious
thing was, that the bird apparently
neared her up from leeward, crossing
her larboard quarter within a fathom
or two, when all of a sudden he got
becalmed, as it were, in the wake
right astern, and by the time either
of us could walk to the ship's taffrail,
she was close over him; as if, whenever
her hull was end-on, it took his
surface-drift away from him, and,
what was more, as if the <i>ship</i> kept
hold of it&mdash;her eighteen feet or so to
his little inch of a draught&mdash;for it
couldn't be owing to the wind. However,
the man-o'-war bird took offer
of the next swell to get air in his
wings, and rose off the heave of it
with a sharp bit of a scream, away
after some black boobies diving for
fish, which no doubt he would catch,
as they dropped them at sight of
him.</p>

<p>The mate upon this started and
looked round, then aloft. "Confound
it!" said he to himself, "if
this breeze would only freshen!
There <i>is</i> a sort of set on the surface
just now," continued he to me, coolly
enough, "though how you idlers
happened to have an idea of it, puzzles
me, unless because you've nothing
else to do but watch the water.
Currents are pretty frequent hereabouts,
however." "Dear me!"
said I, "but if we should should&mdash;"
"Stuff, sir!" said he quickly, "the
coast here must be steep-to enough,
I should think, since if it weren't for
the haze, we'd have sighted it thirty
miles off! What we want is wind&mdash;wind,
to let's cross it." "But
then a calm, Mr Finch," I said; "I'm
hanged afraid of those calms!"
"Well, well, sir," said he, not liking
just to shake me off at once, after my
proving less of a ninny in sea matters
than he had supposed, "these
long currents never set right ashore:
even if we lose the wind, as we may
soon, why, she'll take off into the
eddy seaward, sir, if you <i>must</i> know,&mdash;the
dead-water in-shore, and the
ebb-tide, always give it a safe turn!"
All this, of course, was as much to
satisfy himself as me. "Well, that's
delightful!" said I, as if quite contented,
and Mr Finch walked away
hastily down one of the poop-ladders,
no doubt glad to get rid of me in a
decent manner, though I saw him
next minute glancing in at the compass-boxes.
"Keep her up to her
course, sirrah; luff, d'ye hear!" said
he to Jacobs, who was, perhaps, the
best helmsman aboard. "She falls
off tremendous bad, sir," answered
Jacobs, with another whirl of the
spokes; her want of actual headway
making the Indiaman <i>sag</i> dead away
to leeward, as she shoved into the
force of the sea-stream, running more
and more direct upon her starboard
bow. One minute the courses would
sink in with a long sighing fall to the
lower-masts, the next her topsails
would flutter almost aback, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_727">727</span>
heat even in the shadow of her awnings
was extreme, yet she still seemed
to have a breeze through the white
glare aloft. I was determined to
bring things to a point somehow or
another, so I followed the mate down
the steps. "Oh, by the bye, Mr
Finch!" said I eagerly, "suppose
one of those dreadful&mdash;what do you
call 'em&mdash;ah, tornadoes&mdash;were to come
on! I understand this is just the way,
near Africa&mdash;baffling breeze&mdash;heat
suffocating&mdash;hazy atmosphere&mdash;long
swell&mdash;and current rising to the surface!"
At this Finch stood up in a
perfect fury. "What the devil d'ye
mean, sir," said he, "by dodging me
about the decks in this fashion, with
these infernally foolish questions of
yours?" "Oh, my fine fellow,"
thought I, "you shall settle with me
for that." "Tornadoes never blow
hereabouts, except off-shore, if you
<i>must</i> know, sir!" he rapped out,
sticking his hands in his jacket-pockets
as he said so, and taking a turn
on the quarterdeck. "That's quite
a mistake, I assure you, sir!" said I,
carried away with the spirit of the
thing: "I've seen the contrary fifty
times over, and, from the look of the
sky aloft just now, I'd bet"&mdash;&mdash;here
I stopped, recollected myself, put the
top of my cane in my mouth, and
peered under the awning at the sea
with my eyes half-shut, as sleepily
as usual with my messmates the
cadets. The chief officer, however,
stepped back in surprise, eyed me
sharply, and seemed struck with a
sudden thought. "Why, sir," said
he rather anxiously, "who may&mdash;what
can <i>you</i> know of the matter?"
"Pooh!" replied I, seeing some of
the passengers were coming on deck,
"I'm only of an inquiring turn of
mind! You seafaring persons, Mr
Finch, think we can't get any of that
kind of knowledge on land; but if
you look into Johnson's Dictionary,
why, you'll find the whole thing
under the word Tornado: 'twas one
of the pieces I'd to get by heart before
they'd admit me into our yacht-club&mdash;along
with Falconer's <i>Shipwreck</i>,
you know!" "Indeed!"
said the mate, slowly, with a curl of
his lip, and overhauling me from
head to foot and up again; "ah, indeed!
That was the way, was it,
sir?" I saw 'twas no use. I dare
say he caught the twinkle in my
eye; while Jacob's face, behind him,
was like the knocker on a door with
trying to screw it tight over his quid,
and stuffing the knot of his neckerchief
in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Of course, sir," answered I, letting
my voice fall; "and the long
and the short of it is, Mr Finch, the
sooner you get your ship out of this
current the better! And what's more,
sir, I daresay I could tell you <i>how</i>!"
Whether he was waiting for what
I'd to say, or thinking of something
just occurred to him, but Finch still
gazed steadily at me, without saying
a word; so I went on. "You must
know I had an old uncle who was
long in his Majesty's royal navy,
and if there was one point he was
crazy upon, 'twas just this very matter
of currents&mdash;though, for my part, Mr
Finch, I really never understood what
he meant till I made a voyage. He
used to tell my mother, poor woman,&mdash;who
always fancied they had somewhat
to do with puddings,&mdash;that he'd
seen no less than half-a-dozen ships
go on shore, owing to currents. Now,
Jane, he'd say, when you're fairly in
a current, never you try to cross out
of it, as folks often do, <i>against</i> the run
of it, for in that case, unless the
wind's strong enough, why, instead of
striking the eddy to take your craft
right off-shore, it'll just set you over
and over to the <i>inside</i>. You'll cross,
in the end, no doubt&mdash;but ten to one
it's exactly where the water begins to
shoal; whereas, the right plan's as
simple as daylight, and that's why so
few know it! Look ye, he'd say,
always you cross <i>with</i> the stream&mdash;no
matter though your head seems to
make landward; why, the fact is, it'll
just set you outside of itself, clear into
its own bight, when you can run off to
seaward with the eddy, if ye choose.
<i>That's</i> the way to cross a current, my
uncle used to say, provided you've
but a light wind for handling her with!
Now, Mr Finch," added I, coolly, and
still mouthing my stick as before&mdash;for
I couldn't help wishing to give the
conceited fellow a rub, while I lent
him a hint&mdash;"for my own part, I can't
know much of these things, but it <i>does</i>
seem to me as if my uncle's notions
pretty well suited the case in hand!"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_728">728</span>
Finch was too much of a fair seaman
not to catch my drift at once, but in
too great a passion to own it at the
time. "D'ye think, sir," said he, with
a face like fire, "so much sense as
there is in this long rigmarole of yours,
that I'm such a&mdash;that's to say, that I
didn't know it before, sir? But what
I've got to do with <i>you</i>, Mr Collinson,
or whatever your name may be&mdash;you
may have been at sea twenty years,
for aught I care&mdash;but I'd like to know
<i>why</i> you come aboard here, and give
yourself out for as raw a greenhorn
as ever touched ropes with a kid
glove?" "Well, Mr Finch," said I,
"and what's that to you, if I choose to
be as green as the North Sea whaling-ground?"
"Why, sir," said Finch,
working himself up, "you're devilish
cunning, no doubt, but perhaps you're
not aware that a passenger under a
false rig, in an Indiaman, may be
clapped in limbo, if the captain thinks
fit? Who and what are you, I ask?&mdash;some
runaway master's mate, I
suppose, unless you've got something
deeper in hand! Perhaps," ended he,
with a sneer, "a pickpocket in disguise?"
"Sir," said I, getting up off
the bulwark I'd been leaning upon,
"at <i>present</i> I choose to be a cadet,
but, at any rate, you shall make an
apology for what you said just now,
sir!" "Apology!" said the mate,
turning on his heel, "I shan't do anything
of the sort! You may be
thankful, in the mean time, if I don't
have you locked up below, that's all!
Perhaps, by the bye, sir, all you wanted
was to show off your seamanship
before the young lady in the round-house
there?" Here the glance the
fellow gave me was enough to show
he knew pretty well, all the while,
what we were matched against each
other for.</p>

<p>I could stand this no longer, of
course; but, seeing that one or two of
the passengers were noticing us from
the poop, I looked as polite as possible
to do when you've lost your temper;
and, in fact, the whole disappointment
of this hair-brained cruise of mine&mdash;not
to speak of a few things one had
to stand&mdash;carried me away at the
moment. There was no scheme I
wouldn't rather have been suspected
of, by this time, than the real one&mdash;namely,
having gone in chase of Violet
Hyde. I took a card out of my pocket,
and handed it quietly to Mr Finch.
"You don't seem able to name me,
sir," said I: "however, I give you
my word, you may trust that bit of
pasteboard for it; and as I take you
to be a gentleman by your place in
this ship, why, I shall expect the
satisfaction one gentleman should give
another, the first time we get ashore,
although it <i>should</i> be to-morrow morning!"
And by Jove! thought I, I
hope I'm done with the cursedest
foolish trick ever a fellow played himself!
The man that ventures to call
me <i>green</i> again, or look at me as if he
wanted to cool his eyes, hang me if he
shan't answer for it! As for a woman,
thought I&mdash;but oh, those two blue
eyes yonder&mdash;confound it! as I caught
sight of a white muslin skirt in the
shade of the poop-awning above.
I must say, for Finch, he took my last
move coolly enough, turning round to
give me another look, after glancing
at the card. "Indeed!" said he, as
if rather surprised; "well, sir, I'm
your man for <i>that</i>, though it can't be
just so soon as to-morrow morning!
A Company's officer may meet a lieutenant
in the navy any time&mdash;ay, and
take his ship of the land too, I hope,
sir!" and with that he walked of
forward. Lieutenant! said I to myself;
how did he give me my commission
so pat, I wonder? and I pulled
out another card, when I found, to
my great annoyance, that, in my hurry
that morning, I had happened to put
on a coat of Westwood's by mistake,
and, instead of plain "Mr Collins,"
they were all "Lieutenant Westwood,
R.N." Here's another confounded
mess! thought I, and all will
be blown in the end! However, on
second thoughts, the notion struck me,
that, by sticking to the name, as I
must do <i>now</i> at any rate, why, I
should keep Westwood clear of all
scrapes, which, in <i>his</i> case, might be
disagreeable enough; whereas, at present,
he was known only as the
Reverend Mr Thomas&mdash;and, as for <i>his</i>
either shamming the griffin, or giving
hints how to work the ship, he was one
of those men you'd scarce know for a
sailor, by aught in his manner, at
least; and, indeed, Tom Westwood
always seemed to need a whole frigate's
ways about him, with perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_729">729</span>
somewhat of a stir, to show what he
really was.</p>

<p>Five minutes or so after this, it
didn't certainly surprise me much to
see the Indiaman laid on the opposite
tack, with her head actually north-by-east,
or within a few points of
where the light haze faded into the
sky; the mate seeming by this time
to see the matter clearly, and quietly
making his own of it. The ship began
to stand over towards the outer
set of the current, which could now
be seen rippling along here and there
to the surface, as the breeze fell
slowly: you heard nothing save the
faint plash of it astern under one
counter, the wafting and rustling of
her large main-course above the awnings,
for she was covered over like a
caravan,&mdash;the slight flap of her jibs
far ahead on the bowsprit startled
you now and then as distinctly as if
you got a fillip on your own nose;
the stunsail, high up beside the weather-leech
of her fore-topsail, hung slack
over the boom, and one felt each useless
jolt of the wheel like a foot-slip
in loose sand when you want to run,&mdash;all
betwixt the lazy, listless voices
of the passengers, dropping and dropping
as separate as the last sands in
an hour-glass. Still every minute of
air aloft helped her nearer to where
you saw the water winding about the
horizon in long swathes, as it were,
bluer than the rest, and swelling
brim-full, so to speak, out of a line of
light; with the long dents and bits of
ripple here and there creeping towards
it, till the whole round of the surface,
as far as you could see, came out into
the smooth, like the wrinkles on a
nutmeg. Four bells of the afternoon
watch had struck&mdash;two o'clock that is&mdash;when
Rickett the third mate, and
one or two men, went out to the arm of
the spritsail-yard across the bowsprit,
where they lowered away a heavy
pitch-pot with a long strip of yellow
bunting made fast to it, and weighted
a little at the loose end, to mark the
<i>set</i> of the current: and as the pot
sank away out on her larboard bow,
one could see the bright-coloured rag
deep down through the clear blue-water,
streaming almost fairly <i>north</i>.
She appeared to be nearing the turn
of the eddy, and the chief officer's
spirits began to rise: Rickett screwed
one eye close, and looked out under
his horny palm with the other, doubtful,
as he said, that we should "sight
the land off-deck before that. As
for this trifle of an air aloft, sir," said
he, "I'm afraid we won't"&mdash;"Hoot,
Mr Reckett," put in Macleod, stepping
one of his long trowser-legs down
from over the quarterdeck awning,
like an ostrich that had been aloft,
"ye're aye afraid; but it's not easy
to see, aloft, Mr Fench, sir." "How
does the land lie <i>now</i>, Mr Macleod?"
asked the first officer. "Well, I
wouldn't wonder but we soon dropped
it, sir&mdash;that's to <i>east'ard</i>, I mean,"
replied he; "though it's what we call
a bit mountainous, in Scotland&mdash;not
that unlike the Grampians, Mr Fench,
ye know!" "Hang your Grampians,
man!&mdash;what's <i>ahead</i> of us, eh?" said
the mate hastily. "Why, sir," said
the Scotchman, "there <i>is</i> some more of
it on the nor'east, lower a good deal&mdash;it's
just flush with the water from
here, at present, Mr Fench&mdash;with a
peak or two, trending away too'ard
north; but the light yonder on our
starboard bow makes them hard for
to see, I may say."</p>

<p>In fact, some of the men forward
were making it out already on the
starboard bow, where you soon could
see the faint ragged shape of a headland
coming out, as it were, of the
dazzle beyond the water, which lay
flickering and heaving between, from
deep-blue far away into pale; while
almost at the same time, on her starboard
quarter, where there was less
of the light, another outline was to be
seen looming like pretty high land,
though still fainter than the first. As
for the space betwixt them, for aught
one could distinguish as yet, there
might be nothing <i>there</i> except air and
water over against the ship's side.
"Well," said the mate briskly, after
a little, "we're pretty sure, <i>now</i>, to
have the land-breeze to give us sea-room,
before two or three hours are
over,&mdash;by which time, I hope, we'll
be in the eddy of this infernal current,
at any rate!" However, I was
scarce sure he didn't begin to doubt
the plan I'd given him; whereas had
he known the whole case in time, and
done the thing <i>then</i>, it was certain
enough,&mdash;and the best thing he could
do, even as it was: but what troubled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_730">730</span>
me now, why, suppose anything happened
to the ship, mightn't he turn
the tables on me after all, and say I
had some bad design in it? I loitered
about with my arms folded, saying
never a word, but watching the whole
affair keener than I ever did one of
Shakspeare's plays in the theatre after
a dull cruise; not a thing in sea, sky,
or Indiaman, from the ripples far off
on the water to ugly Harry hauling
taut the jib-sheet with his chums, but
somehow or other they seemed all to
sink <i>into</i> me at the time, as if they'd
all got to come <i>out</i> again strong.
You hardly knew <i>when</i> the ship lost
the last breath of air aloft, till, from
stealing through the smooth water,
she came apparently to a stand-still,
everything spread broad out, not even
a flap in the canvass, almost, it had
fallen a dead calm so gradually.</p>

<p>However <i>my</i> troubles weren't seemingly
over yet, for just then up came
the Judge's dark kitmagar to the
gangway where I was, and, from the
sly impudence of the fellow's manner,
I at once fancied there was something
particular in the wind, as if he'd been
seeking me about-decks. "S'laam,
mistree!" said he, with but a slight
duck of his flat brown turban, "Judge
sahib i-send Culley Mistree his chupprass,"&mdash;<i>message</i>,
forsooth!&mdash;"sah'b
inquire the flavour of gentlyman's Ees-Inchee
Coompanee, two-three moment!"
"The flavour of my East-India
company, you rascal!" said I
laughing, yet inclined to kick him aft
again for his impertinent look; "speak
for yourself, if you please!" In fact the
whiff of cocoa-nut oil, and other dark
perfumes about him, came out in a
hot calm at sea, when everything
sickens one, so as to need no inquiry
about the matter: however, I walked
straight aft to the round-house, and
in at the open door, through which Sir
Charles was to be seen pacing from
one side of his cabin to the other, like
a Bengal tiger in a cage. "Harkye,
young man," said he sternly, turning
as soon as I came in, with my hat in
my hand, "since I had the honour of
your company here this morning, I
have recollected&mdash;indeed I find that
one of my servants had done the same&mdash;that
you are the person who molested
my family by various annoyances
beside my garden at Croydon, sir!"
"Indeed, Sir Charles!" said I coolly,
for the bitter feeling I had made me
cool: "they must have been unintentional
then, sir! But I was certainly
at Croydon, seeing my mother's house
happens to be there." "You must
have had some design in entering this
vessel, sir!" continued the Judge, in a
passion; "'gad sir, the coincidence is
too curious! Tell me what it is at
once, or by &mdash;" "My design was to
go to India, sir," answered I, as
quietly as before. "In what capacity?&mdash;who
are you?&mdash;what&mdash;who&mdash;what
do you want <i>there</i>, eh?" rapped out
the Judge. "I'm not aware, sir,"
said I, "what right you've got to,
question me; but I&mdash;in fact I'll tell
<i>so</i> much to any man&mdash;why, I'm an
officer in the navy." Sir Charles
brought short up in his pacing and
stamping, and stared at me. "An
officer in the navy!" repeated he;
"but yes&mdash;why&mdash;now I think, I do,
remember something in your dress,
sir,&mdash;though it was the <i>face</i> that struck
me! In short then, sir, this makes,
the case worse: you are here on false
pretences&mdash;affecting the very reverse,
sir&mdash;setting yourself up for a model of
simplicity,&mdash;a laughing-stock indeed!"
"I had reasons for not wishing my
profession to be known, Sir Charles,"
said I; "most special reasons. They're
now over, however, and I don't care
<i>who</i> knows it!" "May I ask what
these were?" said the Judge. "<i>That</i>
I'll never tell to any man breathing!"
I said, determinedly. The Judge
walked two or three times fore and
aft; then a thought seemed to strike
him&mdash;he looked out as if at the decks
and through below the awnings, then
shut the door and came back to me
again. "By the way," said he seriously,
and changing his tone, "since
this extraordinary acknowledgment
of yours, sir, something occurs to me
which makes me almost think your
presence in the vessel, in one sense,
opportune. I have reason to entertain
a high opinion of naval officers as
technical men, professionally educated
in his Majesty's regular service, and&mdash;you
look rather a <i>young</i> man&mdash;but
have you had much experience, may I
ask?" "I have been nine or ten
years at sea, sir," replied I, a little
taken aback, "in various parts of the
world!" "I have some suspicion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_731">731</span>
lately," he went on, "that this vessel
is not navigated in a&mdash;in short, that
at present, probably, we may be in
some danger,&mdash;do <i>you</i> think so, sir?"
"No, Sir Charles," I said, "I don't
think she <i>is</i>, as matters stand,&mdash;only
in a troublesome sort of quarter,
which the sooner she's out of, the
better." "The commander is, I find,
dangerously unwell," continued he,
"and of the young man who seems to
have the chief care of the vessel, I
have no very high&mdash;well&mdash;<i>that</i>, of
course I&mdash; Now sir," said he, looking
intently at me, "are <i>you</i> capable of&mdash;in
short of managing this Company's
vessel, should any emergency arise?
I have seen such, myself,&mdash;and in the
circumstances I feel considerable
alarm&mdash;uneasiness, at least!&mdash;Eh,
sir?" "Depend upon it, Sir Charles,"
I said, stepping toward the door, "in
any matter of the kind I'll do my best
for this ship! But none knows so
well as a seaman, there are cases
enough where your very best can't do
much!" The Judge seemed rather
startled by my manner&mdash;for I <i>did</i> feel
a little misgiving, from something in
the weather on the whole; at any
rate I fancied there was a cold-bloodedness
in every sharp corner of his
face, bilious though his temper was,
that would have let him see <i>me</i> go to
the bottom a thousand times over,
had I even had a chance with his
daughter herself, ere he'd have yielded
me the tip of her little finger: accordingly
'twas a satisfaction to me, at the
moment, just to make him see he
wasn't altogether in his nabob's
chair in Bengal yet, on an elephant's
back!</p>

<p>"Ah, though!" said he, raising his
voice to call me back, "to return for
an instant&mdash;there is one thing I must
positively require, sir&mdash;which you will
see, in the circumstances, to be unavoidable.
As a mere simple cadet, observe
sir, there was nothing to be objected
to in a slight passing acquaintance&mdash;but,
especially in the&mdash;in short equivocal&mdash;sir,
I must request of you that
you will on no account attempt to hold
any communication with my daughter,
Miss Hyde&mdash;beyond a mere bow, of
course! 'Twill be disagreeable, I assure
you. Indeed, I shall&mdash;" "Sir,"
said I, all the blood in my body going
to my face, "of all things in the world,
<i>that</i> is the very thing where your views
and mine happen to square!" and I
bowed. The man's coolness disgusted
me, sticking such a thing in my teeth,
after just reckoning on my services
with the very same breath,&mdash;and all
when it wasn't required, too! And
by heaven! thought I, had <i>she</i>
shown me favour, all the old nabobs
in Christendom, and the whole
world to boot, shouldn't hinder me
from speaking to her! What I said
apparently puzzled him, but he gave
me a grand bow in his turn, and I had
my hand on the door, when he said,
"I suppose, sir, as a naval officer, you
have no objection to give me your
name and rank? I forget what&mdash;"
Here I remembered my mistake with
the mate, and on the whole I saw I
must stick by it till I was clear of the
whole concern,&mdash;as for <i>saying</i> my
name was Westwood, that I couldn't
have done at the time for worlds, but
I quietly handed him another card;
meaning, of course, to give Westwood
the cue as shortly as possible, for his
own safety. The Judge started on
seeing the card, gave me one of his
sharp glances, and made a sudden step
towards me. "Have you any relation
in India, Mr Westwood?" said he,
slowly; to which I gave only a nod.
"What is he, if I may inquire?"
asked he again. "A councillor or
something, I believe," said I carelessly.
"<i>Thomas</i> Westwood?" said
Sir Charles. "Ah," said I, wearied
of the thing, and anxious to go. "An
uncle, probably, from the age?" he
still put in. "Exactly, that's it!"
I said. "Why&mdash;what!&mdash;why did
you not mention this at first?" he
broke out suddenly, coming close up;
"why, Councillor Westwood is my
very oldest friend in India, my dear
sir! This alters the matter. I should
have welcomed a nephew of his in my
house, to the utmost! Why, how
strange, Mr Westwood, that the fact
should emerge in this curious manner!"&mdash;and
with that he held out his
hand. "Of course," said he, "no
such restriction as I mentioned could
for a moment apply to a nephew of
Councillor Westwood!" I stared at
him for a moment, and then&mdash;"Sir,"
said I, coolly, "it seems the whole
matter goes by names; but if my name
were the devil, or the apostle Paul, I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_732">732</span>
don't see how it can make a bit of
difference in <i>me</i>: what's more, sir,"
said I, setting my teeth, "what<i>ever</i>
my name may be, depend upon it, I
shall never claim acquaintance either
with you or&mdash;or&mdash;Miss Hyde!" With
that I flung straight out of the cabin,
leaving the old gentleman bolt upright
on the floor, and as dumb as a stock-fish,
whether with rage or amazement
I never stopped to think.</p>

<p>I went right forward on the Indiaman's
forecastle, clear of all the awnings,
dropped over her head out of
sight of the men, and sat with my legs
amongst the open wood-work beneath
the bowsprit, looking at the calm,&mdash;nobody
in sight but the Hindoo figure,
who seemed to be doing the same.
<i>Westwood!</i> thought I bitterly;
then in a short time, when the mistake's
found out, and he got safe past
the Cape, perhaps,&mdash;it'll be nothing
but Westwood! He'll have a clear
stage, and all favour; but at any rate,
how<i>ever</i> it may be, <i>I</i>'ll not be here,
by heaven! to see it. That cursed
councillor of his, I suppose, is another
nabob,&mdash;and no doubt he'll marry her,
all smooth! Uncles be&mdash; I little
thought, by Jove! when I knocked off
that yarn to the mate about <i>my</i> uncle&mdash;but,
after all, it's strange how often
a fellow's paid back in his own coin!
The heat at the time was unbearable,&mdash;<i>heat</i>,
indeed! 'twasn't only heat,&mdash;but
a heavy, close, stifling sort of a
feeling, like in a hot-house, as if you'd
got a weight on your head and every
other bit of you: the water one time
so dead-blue and glassy between the
windings of it, that the sky seemed
to vanish, and the ship looked floating
up into where <i>it</i> was,&mdash;then again
you scarce knew sea from air, except
by the wrinkles and eddies running
across each other between, toward a
sullen blue ring at the horizon,&mdash;like
seeing through a big, twisted sieve,
or into a round looking-glass all over
cracks. I heard them clue up every
thing aloft, except the topsails,&mdash;and
<i>they</i> fell slapping back and forward to
the masts, every now and then, with a
<i>thud</i> like a thousand spades clapped
down at once over a hollow bit of
ground&mdash;till all seemed as still between
as if they'd buried something.
I wished to heaven it were what I
<i>felt</i> at the time, and the thought of Violet
Hyde, that I might be as if I never
had seen her,&mdash;when on glancing up,
betwixt the figure-head and the ship's
stern, it struck me to notice how much
the land on her starboard bow and
beam seemed to have risen, even during
the last hour, and that without
wind; partly on account of its clearing
in that quarter, perhaps; but the
nearest points looked here and there
almost as if you could see into them,
roughening barer out through the hue
of the distance, like purple blotches
spreading in it. Whereas, far away
astern of us, when I crossed over her
headworks, there were two or three thin
white streaks of haze to be seen just
on the horizon, one upon another, above
which you made out somewhat like a
dim range of peaked land, trending
one couldn't say how far back&mdash;all
showing how fairly the coast was shutting
her in upon the south-east, as
she set farther in-shore, even while
the run of the current bade fair to
take her well clear of it ahead; which
was of course all we need care for at
present. Her want of steerage-way,
however, let the Indiaman sheer
hither and thither, till at times one
was apt to get confused, and suppose
her more in with the land-loom than
she really was. Accordingly the mate
proved his good judgment by having
a couple of boats lowered with a tow-line,
to keep her at least stern-on to
the current,&mdash;although the trouble of
getting out the launch would have
more served his purpose, and the
deeper loaded the better, since in fact
there were <i>two</i> favourable drifts instead
of one, between every stroke of the
oars. The men pulled away rather
sulkily, their straw hats over their
noses, the dip of the hawser scarce
tautening at each strain, as they
squinted up at the Seringapatam's idle
figure-head. For my part I had thought
it better to leave him by himself, and
go below.</p>

<p>When I went into the cuddy, more
for relief's sake than to dine, the passengers
were chattering and talking
away round the tables, hot and choking
though it was, in high glee because
the land was in sight from the
starboard port-window, and they fancied
the officers had changed their
mind as to "touching" there. Every
now and then a cadet or two would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_733">733</span>
start up, with their silver forks in
their hands, and put their heads out;
some asked whether the anchor had
been seen getting ready or not;
others disputed about the colour of
tropical trees, if they were actually
green like English ones, or perhaps all
over blossoms and fruit together&mdash;the
whole of them evidently expecting
bands of negroes to line the shore as
we came in. One young fellow had
taken a particular fancy to have an
earthworm, with earth enough to feed
it all the rest of the voyage, otherwise
he couldn't stand it; and little Tommy's
mother almost went into hysterics
again, when she said, if she
could just eat a lettuce salad once
more, she'd die contented; the missionary
looking up through his spectacles,
in surprise that she wasn't
<i>more</i> interested about the slave-trade,
whereof he'd been talking to her. As
for Westwood, he joined quietly in
the fun, with a glance now and then
across to me; however, I pretended
to be too busy with the salt beef, and
was merely looking up again for a
moment, when my eye chanced to
catch on the swinging barometer that
hung in the raised skylight, right
over the midst of our noise. By
George! ma'am, what was my horror
when I saw the quicksilver had sunk
so far below the mark, probably fixed
there that morning, as to be almost
shrunk in the ball! Whatever the
merchant service might know about
the instrument in those days, the African
coast was the place to teach its
right use to us in the old Iris. I laid
down my knife and fork as carelessly
as I could, and went straight on
deck.</p>

<p>Here I sought out the mate, who
was forward, watching the land&mdash;and
at once took him aside to tell him the
fact. "Well, sir," said he coolly, "and
what of that? A sign of wind, certainly,
before very long; but in the
meantime we're <i>sure</i> to have it off the
land." "That's one of the very reasons,"
said I, "for thinking <i>this</i> will
be from seaward&mdash;since towards evening
the land'll have plenty of air without
it! But more than that, sir," said
I, "I tell you, Mr Finch, I know the
west coast of Africa pretty well&mdash;and
so far south as this, the glass falling so
low as <i>twenty-seven</i>, is always the sign
of a nor'westerly blow! If you're a
wise man, sir, you'll not only get your
upper spars down on deck, but you'll
see your anchors clear!" Finch had
plainly got furious at my meddling
again, and said he, "Instead of that,
sir, I shall hold on <i>everything</i> aloft, to
stand out when I get the breeze!"
"D'ye really think, then," said I,
pointing to the farthest-off streak of
land, trending away by this time
astern of us, faint as it was; "<i>do</i> you
think you could ever weather that
point, with anything like a strong
nor'-wester, besides a current heading
you in, as you got fair hold of it
again?" "Perhaps not," said he,
wincing a little as he glanced at it,
"but you happen always to suppose
what there's a thousand to one against,
sir! Why, sir, you might as well take
the command at once! But, by G&mdash;&mdash;!
sir, if it <i>did</i> come to that, I'd rather&mdash;I'd
rather see the ship <i>lost</i>&mdash;I'd rather
go to the bottom with all in her,
after handling her as I know well
how, than I'd see the chance given to
<i>you</i>!" The young fellow fairly shouted
this last word into my very ear&mdash;he
was in a regular furious passion.
"You'd <i>better</i> let me alone, that's all
I've got to say to you, sir!" growled
he as he turned away; so I thought it
no use to say more, and leant over
the bulwarks, resolved to see it out.</p>

<p>The fact was, the farther we got off
the land <i>now</i>, the worse&mdash;seeing that
if what I dreaded should prove true,
why, we were probably in thirty or
forty fathoms water, where no anchor
could hold for ten minutes' time&mdash;if it
ever caught ground. My way would
have been, to get every boat out at
once, and tow in till you could see the
colour of some shoal or other from
aloft, then take my chance there to
ride out whatever might come, to the
last cable aboard of us. Accordingly
I wasn't sorry to see that by this time
the whole bight of the coast was slowly
rising off our beam, betwixt the high
land far astern and the broad bluffs
upon her starboard bow; which last
came out already of a sandy reddish
tint, and the lower part of a clear
blue, as the sun got westward on our
other side. What struck me was, that
the face of the water, which was all
over wrinkles and winding lines, with
here and there a quick ripple, when I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_734">734</span>
went below, had got on a sudden quite
smooth as far as you could see, as if
they'd sunk down like so many eels;
a long uneasy ground-swell was beginning
to heave in from seaward, on
which the ship rose; once or twice I
fancied I could observe the colour
different away towards the land, like
the muddy chocolate spreading out
near a river mouth at ebb-tide,&mdash;then
again it was green, rather; and as for
the look of the coast, I had no knowledge
of it. I thought again, certainly,
of the old quartermaster's account in
the Iris, but there was neither anything
like it to be seen, nor any sign
of a break in the coast at all, though
high headlands enough.</p>

<p>The ship might have been about
twelve or fourteen miles from the
north-east point upon her starboard
bow, a high rocky range of bluffs,&mdash;and
rather less from the nearest of what
lay away off her beam,&mdash;but after this
you could mark nothing more, except
it were that she edged farther from the
point, by the way its bearings shifted
or got blurred together: either she
stood still, or she'd caught some eddy
or under-drift, and the mate walked
about quite lively once more. The
matter was, how to breathe, or bear
your clothes&mdash;when all of a sudden I
heard the second mate sing out from
the forecastle&mdash;"Stand by the braces,
there! Look out for the topes'l hawl-yairds!"
He came shuffling aft next
moment as fast as his foundered old
shanks could carry him, and told Mr
Finch there was a squall coming off
the land. The mate sprang up on the
bulwarks, and so did I&mdash;catching
a glance from him as much as to
say&mdash;There's your gale from seaward,
you pretentious lubber! The lowest
streak of coast bore at present before
our starboard quarter, betwixt east
and south-east'ard, with some pretty
high land running away up from it,
and a sort of dim blue haze hanging
beyond, as 'twere. Just as Macleod
spoke, I could see a dusky dark vapour
thickening and spreading in the haze,
till it rose black along the flat, out of
the sky behind it; whitened and then
darkened again, like a heavy smoke
floating up into the air. All was confusion
on deck for a minute or two&mdash;off
went all the awnings&mdash;and every
hand was ready at his station, fisting
the ropes; when I looked again at
the cloud, then at the mates, then at
it again. "<i>By</i> George!" said I,
noticing a pale wreath of it go curling
on the pale clear sky over it, as if to
a puff of air,&mdash;"it <i>is</i> smoke! Some
niggers, as they so often do, burning
the bush!" So it was; and as soon as
Finch gave in, all hands quietly coiled
up the ropes. It was scarce five
minutes after, that Jacobs, who was
coiling up a rope beside me, gave me
a quiet touch with one finger&mdash;"Mr
Collins, sir," said he in a low voice,
looking almost right up, high over
toward the ship's larboard bow, which
he couldn't have done before, for the
awnings so lately above us,&mdash;"look,
sir&mdash;there's an <i>ox-eye</i>!" I followed
his gaze, but it wasn't for a few
seconds that I found what it pointed
to, in the hot far-off-like blue dimness
of the sky overhead, compared with
the white glare of which to westward
our canvass aloft was but dirty gray
and yellow.</p>

<p>'Twas what none but a seaman
would have observed, and many a
seaman wouldn't have done, so,&mdash;but
a man-o'-war's-man is used to look
out at all hours, in all latitudes,&mdash;and
to a man that knew its meaning, <i>this</i>
would have been no joke, even out of
sight of land: as it was, the thing
gave me a perfect thrill of dread.
High aloft in the heavens northward,
where they were freest from the sun&mdash;now
standing over the open horizon
amidst a wide bright pool of light,&mdash;you
managed to discern a small silvery
speck, growing slowly as it were out
of the faint blue hollow, like a star in
the day-time, till you felt as if it
<i>looked</i> at you, from God-knows what
distance away. One eye after another
amongst the mates and crew joined
Jacobs's and mine, with the same sort
of dumb fellowship to be seen when a
man in London streets watches the
top of a steeple; and however hard
to make out at first, ere long none of
them could miss seeing it, as it got
slowly larger, sinking by degrees till
the sky close about it seemed to
thicken like a dusky ring round the
white, and the sunlight upon our seaward
quarter blazed out doubly
strong&mdash;as if it came dazzling off a
brass bell, with the bright tongue
swinging in it far off to one side,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_735">735</span>
where the hush made you think of a
stroke back upon us, with some terrific
sound to boot. The glassy water
by this time was beginning to rise
under the ship with a struggling
kind of unequal heave, as if a giant
you couldn't see kept shoving it down
here and there with both hands, and
it came swelling up elsewhere. To
north-westward or thereabouts, betwixt
the sun and this ill-boding token
aloft, the far line of open sea still lay
shining motionless and smooth; next
time you looked, it had got even
brighter than before, seeming to leave
the horizon visibly; then the streak
of air just above it had grown gray,
and a long edge of hazy vapour was
creeping as it were over from beyond,&mdash;the
white speck all the while travelling
down towards it slantwise
from nor'ard, and spreading its dark
ring slowly out into a circle of cloud,
till the keen eye of it at last sank in,
and below, as well as aloft, the whole
north-western quarter got blurred
together in one gloomy mass. If
there was a question at first whether
the wind mightn't come from so far
nor'ard as to give her a chance of
running out to sea before it, there
was none now,&mdash;our sole recourse lay
either in getting nearer the land
meanwhile, to let go our anchors ere
it came on, with her head <i>to</i> it,&mdash;or
we might make a desperate trial to
weather the lee-point now far astern.
The fact was, we were going to have
a regular tornado, and that of the
worst kind, which wouldn't soon blow
itself out; though near an hour's
notice would probably pass ere it was
on.</p>

<p>The three mates laid their heads
gravely together over the capstan for
a minute or two, after which Finch
seemed to perceive that the first of
the two ways was the safest; though
of course the nearer we should get to
the land, the less chance there was of
clearing it afterwards, should her
cables part, or the anchors drag. The
two boats still alongside, and two
others dropped from the davits, were
manned at once and set to towing the
Indiaman ahead, in-shore; while the
bower and sheet anchors were got
out to the cat-heads ready for letting
go, cables overhauled, ranged, and
clinched as quickly as possible, and
the deep-sea lead passed along to take
soundings every few minutes.</p>

<p>On we crept, slow as death, and
almost as still, except the jerk of the
oars from the heaving water at her
bows, and the loud flap of the big
topsails now and then, everything
aloft save them and the brailed foresail
being already close furled; the
clouds all the while rising away along
our larboard beam nor'west and
north, over the gray bank on the
horizon, till once more you could
scarce say which point the wind
would come from, unless by the huge
purple heap of vapour in the midst.
The sun had got low, and he shivered
his dazzling spokes of light behind
one edge of it, as if 'twere a mountain
you saw over some coast or other:
indeed, you'd have thought the ship
almost shut in by land on both sides
of her, which was what seemed to
terrify the passengers most, as they
gathered about the poop-stairs and
watched it,&mdash;<i>which</i> was the true land
and which the clouds, 'twas hard to
say,&mdash;and the sea gloomed writhing
between them like a huge lake in the
mountains. I saw Sir Charles Hyde
walk out of the round-house and in
again, glancing uneasily about: his
daughter was standing with another
young lady, gazing at the land; and
at sight of her sweet, curious face, I'd
have given worlds to be able to do
something that might save it from the
chance, possibly, of being that very
night dashed amongst the breakers on
a lee-shore in the dark&mdash;or at best,
suppose the Almighty favoured any
of us so far, perhaps landed in the
wilds of Africa. Had there been
aught man could do more, why, though
I never should get a smile for it, I'd
have compassed it, mate or no mate;
but all was done that could be done
and I had nothing to say. Westwood
came near her, too, apparently seeing
our bad case at last to some extent,
and both trying to break it to her and
to assure her mind; so I folded my
arms again, and kept my eyes hard
fixed upon the bank of cloud, as some
new weather-mark stole out in it, and
the sea stretched breathless away below,
like new-melted lead. The air
was like to choke you&mdash;or rather there
was none&mdash;as if water, sky, and everything
else wanted <i>life</i>, and one would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_736">736</span>
fain have caught the first rush of the
tornado into his mouth&mdash;the men
emptying the dipper on deck from the
cask, from sheer loathing. As for the
land, it seemed to draw nearer of itself,
till every point and wrinkle in
the headland off our bow came out in
a red coppery gleam&mdash;one saw the
white line of surf round it, and some
blue country beyond like indigo; then
back it darkened again, and all aloft
was getting livid-like over the bare
royal mast-heads.</p>

<p>Suddenly a faint air was felt to
flutter from landward; it half lifted
the top-sails, and a heavy earthy
swell came into your nostrils&mdash;the first
of the land-breeze, at last; but by
this time it was no more than a sort
of mockery, while a minute after you
might catch a low, sullen, moaning
sound far of through the emptiness,
from the strong surf the Atlantic sends
in upon the West Coast before a squall.
If ever landsmen found out what land
on the wrong side is, the passengers
of the Seringapatam did, that moment;
the shudder of the top-sails aloft
seemed to pass into every one's
shoulders, and a few quietly walked
below, as if they were safe in their
cabins. I saw Violet Hyde look
round and round with a startled expression,
and from one face to another,
till her eye lighted on me, and I
fancied for a moment it was like putting
some question to me. I couldn't
bear it!&mdash;'twas the first time I'd felt
powerless to offer anything; though
the thought ran through me again till
I almost felt myself buffeting among
the breakers with her in my arms.
I looked to the land, where the smoke
we had seen three-quarters of an
hour ago rose again with the puff of
air, a slight flicker of flame in it, as it
wreathed off the low ground toward
the higher point,&mdash;when all at once I
gave a start, for something in the
shape of the whole struck me as if I'd
seen it before. Next moment I was
thinking of old Bob Martin's particular
landmarks at the river mouth he spoke
of, and the notion of its possibly being
hereabouts glanced on me like a god-send.
In the unsure dusky sight I
had of it, certainly, it wore somewhat
of that look, and it lay fair to leeward
of the weather; while, as for the dead
shut-in appearance of it, old Bob had
specially said you'd never think it was
a river; but then again it was more
like a desperate fancy owing to our
hard case, and to run the ship straight
for it would be the trick of a bedlamite.
At any rate a quick cry from
aft turned me round, and I saw a blue
flare of lightning streak out betwixt
the bank of gray haze and the cloud
that hung over it&mdash;then another, and
the clouds were beginning to rise
slowly in the midst, leaving a white
glare between, as if you could see
through it towards what was coming.
The men could pull no longer, but
ahead of the ship there was now only
about eight or ten fathoms water,
with a soft bottom. The boats were
hoisted in, and the men had begun to
clue up and hand the topsails, which
were lowered on the caps, when, just
in the midst of the hubbub and confusion,
as I stood listening to every
order the mate gave, the steward came
up hastily from below to tell him that
the captain had woke up, and, being,
much better, wanted to see him immediately.
Mr Finch looked surprised,
but he turned at once, and
hurried down the hatchway.</p>

<p>The sight which all of us who
weren't busy gazed upon, over the
larboard bulwarks, was terrible to see:
'twas half dark, though the sun, dropping
behind the haze-bank, made it
glimmer and redden. The dark heap
of clouds had first lengthened out
blacker and blacker, and was rising
slowly in the sky like a mighty arch,
till you saw their white edges below,
and a ghastly white space behind, out
of which the mist and scud began to
fly. Next minute a long sigh came
into her jib and foresail, then the
black bow of cloud partly sank again,
and a blaze of lightning came out all
round her, showing you every face on
deck, the inside of the round-house
aft, with the Indian Judge standing in
it, his hand to his eyes,&mdash;and the land
far away, to the very swell rolling in
to it. Then the thunder broke overhead
in the gloom, in one fearful sudden
crack, that you seemed to hear
through every corner of cabins and
forecastle below,&mdash;and the wet back-fins
of twenty sharks or so, that
had risen out of the inky surface,
vanished as suddenly. The Indiaman
had sheered almost broadside on to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_737">737</span>
the clouds, her jib was still up, and I
knew the next time the clouds <i>rose</i> we
should fairly have it. Flash after flash
came, and clap after clap of thunder,
<i>such</i> as you hear before a tornado&mdash;yet
the chief officer wasn't to be seen,
and the others seemed uncertain what
to do first; while every one began to
wonder and pass along questions
where he could be. In fact, he had
disappeared. For my part, I thought
it very strange he staid so long; but
there wasn't a moment to lose. I
jumped down off the poop-stairs,
walked forward on the quarterdeck,
and said coolly to the men nearest
me, "Run and haul down that jib
yonder&mdash;set the spanker here, aft.
You'll have her taken slap on her
beam: quick, my lads!" The men
did so at once. Macleod was calling
out anxiously for Mr Finch. "Stand
by the anchors there!" I sang out,
"to let go the starboard one, the
<i>moment</i> she swings head to wind!"
The Scotch mate turned his head; but
Rickett's face, by the next flash, showed
he saw the good of it, and there
was no leisure for arguing, especially
as I spoke in a way to be heard. I
walked to the wheel, and got hold of
Jacobs to take the weather-helm. We
were all standing ready, at the pitch
of expecting it. Westwood, too, having
appeared again by this time beside
me, I whispered to him to run forward
and look after the anchors&mdash;when
some one came hastily up the
after-hatchway, with a glazed hat and
pilot-coat on, stepped straight to the
binnacle, looked in behind me, then
at the black bank of cloud, then aloft.
Of course I supposed it was the mate
again, but didn't trouble myself to
glance at him farther&mdash;when "Hold
on with the anchors!" he sang out in
a loud voice&mdash;"hold on there for your
lives!" Heavens! it was the captain
himself!</p>

<p>At this, of course, I stood aside at
once; and he shouted again, "Hoist
the jib and fore-topmast-staysail&mdash;stand
by to set fore-course!" By
Jove! this was the way to pay the
ship <i>head</i> off, instead of stern off,
from the blast when it came&mdash;and to
let her drive before it at no trifle of a
rate, wherever <i>that</i> might take her!
"<i>Down</i> with that spanker, Mr Macleod,
d'ye hear!" roared Captain
Williamson again; and certainly I did
wonder what he meant to do with the
ship. But his manner was so decided,
and 'twas so natural for the captain to
strain a point to come on deck in the
circumstances, that I saw he must
have some trick of seamanship above
<i>me</i>, or some special knowledge of the
coast,&mdash;and I waited in a state of the
greatest excitement for the first stroke
of the tornado. He waved the second
and third mates forward to their posts&mdash;the
Indiaman sheering and backing,
like a frightened horse, to the long
slight swell and the faint flaw of the
land air. The black arch to windward
began to rise again, showing a terrible
white stare reaching deep in, and a
blue dart of lightning actually ran
zig-zag down before our glaring fore-to'gallant-mast.
Suddenly the captain
had looked at me, and we faced
each other by the gleam; and quiet,
easy-going man as he was commonly,
it just flashed across me there was
something extraordinarily wild and
<i>raised</i> in his pale visage, strange as
the air about us made every one
appear. He gave a stride towards me,
shouting "Who are&mdash;" when the thunder-clap
took the words out of his
tongue, and next moment the tornado
burst upon us, fierce as the wind from
a cannon's month. For one minute
the Seringapatam heeled over to her
starboard streak, almost broadside on,
and her spars toward the land,&mdash;all
on her beam was a long ragged white
gush of light and mist pouring out
under the black brow of the clouds,
with a trampling eddying roar up into
the sky. The swell plunged over her
weather-side like the first break of a
dam, and as we scrambled up to the
bulwarks, to hold on for bare life, you
saw a roller, fit to swamp us, coming
on out of the sheet of foam&mdash;when
crash went mizen-topmast and main-to'gallant-mast:
the ship payed swiftly
off by help of her head-sails, and, with
a leap like a harpooned whale, off she
drove fair before the tremendous
sweep of the blast.</p>

<p>The least yaw in her course, and
she'd have never risen, unless every
stick went out of her. I laid my
shoulder to the wheel with Jacobs,
and Captain Williamson screamed
through his trumpet into the men's
ears, and waved his hands to ride
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_738">738</span>
down the fore-sheets as far as they'd
go; which kept her right before it,
though the sail could be but half-set,
and she rather flew than ran&mdash;the
sea one breadth of white foam back to
the gushes of mist, not having power
to rise higher yet. Had the foresail
been stretched, 'twould have blown
off like a cloud. I looked at the captain:
he was standing in the lee of the
round-house, straight upright, though
now and then peering eagerly forward,
his lips firm, one hand on a
belaying-pin, the other in his breast&mdash;nothing
but determination in his
manner; yet once or twice he started,
and glanced fiercely to the after-hatchway
near, as if something
from below might chance to thwart
him. I can't express my contrary
feelings, betwixt a sort of hope and
sheer horror. We were driving right
towards the land, at thirteen or fourteen
knots to the hour,&mdash;yet <i>could</i>
there actually be some harbourage
hereaway, or that said river the
quarter-master of the Iris mentioned,
and Captain Williamson know
of it? Something struck me as wonderfully
strange in the whole matter,
and puzzling to desperation,&mdash;still I
trusted to the captain's experience.
The coast was scarce to be seen
ahead of us, lying black against an
uneven streak of glimmer, as she
rushed like fury before the deafening
howl of wind; and right away before
our lee-beam I could see the light
blowing, as it were, across beyond
the headland I had noticed, where
the smoke in the bush seemed to be
still curling, half-smothered, along the
flat in the lee of the hills, as if in
green wood, or sheltered as yet from
seaward, though once or twice a
quick flicker burst up in it. All
at once the gust of the tornado was
seen to pour on it, like a long blast
from some huge bellows, and up it
flashed&mdash;the yellow flame blazed into
the smoke, spread away behind the
point, and the ruddy brown smoke
blew whitening off over it:&mdash;when,
Almighty power! what did I see as it
lengthened in, but part after part of
old Bob's landmarks creep out ink-black
before the flare and the streak
of sky together&mdash;first the low line of
ground, then the notch in the block,
the two rocks like steps, and the
sugar-loaf shape of the headland, to
the very mop-headed knot of trees on
its rise! No doubt Captain Williamson
was steering for it; but it was
far too much on our starboard bow&mdash;and
in half an hour at this rate we
should drive right into the surf you
saw running along to the coast ahead&mdash;so
I signed to Jacobs for god-sake
to edge her off as nicely as was possible.
Captain Williamson caught
my motion. "Port! port, sirrah!"
he sang out sternly; "<i>back</i> with the
helm, d'ye hear!" and, pulling out a
pistol, he levelled it at me with one
hand, while he held a second in the
other. "Land!&mdash;land, by G&mdash;d!"
shouted he, and from the lee of the
round-house it came more like a shriek
than a shout&mdash;"I'll be there though
a thousand mutineers&mdash;" His eye
was like a wild beast's. That moment
the truth glanced across me&mdash;this was
the <i>green leaf</i>, no doubt, the Scotch
mate talked so mysteriously of. The
man was mad! The land-fever was
upon him, as I'd seen it before in men
long off the African coast; and he
stood eyeing me with one foot hard
stamped before him. 'Twas no use
trying to be heard, and the desperation
of the moment gave me a thought
of the sole thing to do. I took off my
hat in the light of the binnacle, bowed,
and looked him straight in the face
with a smile&mdash;when his eye wavered,
he slowly lowered his pistol, then
<i>laughed</i>, waving his hand towards the
land to leeward, as if, but for the gale,
you'd have heard him cheer. At the
instant I sprang behind him with the
slack of a rope, and grappled his arms
fast, though he'd got the furious
power of a madman, and, during half
a minute, 'twas wrestle for life with
me. But the line was round him, arm
and leg, and I made it fast, throwing
him heavily on the deck, just as one
of the mates, with some of the crew,
were struggling aft, by help of the belaying-pins,
against the hurricane,
having caught a glimpse of the thing
by the binnacle-light. They looked
from me to the captain. The ugly top-man
made a sign, as much as to say,
knock the fellow down; but the whole
lot hung back before the couple of
pistol-barrels I handled. The Scotch
mate seemed awfully puzzled; and
others of the men, who knew from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">739</span>
Jacobs what I was, came shoving
along, evidently aware what a case
we were in. A word to Jacobs served
to keep him steering her anxiously,
so as to head two or three points more
south-east in the <i>end</i>, furiously as the
wheel jolted. So there we stood, the
tornado sweeping sharp as a knife
from astern over the poop-deck, with
a force that threw any one back if he
left go his hold to get near me, and
going up like thunder aloft in the
sky. Now and then a weaker flare
of lightning glittered across the scud;
and, black as it was overhead, the horizon
to windward was but one jagged
white glare, gushing full of broad
shifting streaks through the drift of
foam and the spray that strove to rise.
Our fore-course still held; and I took
the helm from Jacobs, that he might
go and manage to get a pull taken on
the starboard brace, which would not
only <i>slant</i> the sail more to the blasts,
but give her the better chance to make
the sole point of salvation, by helping
her steerage when most needed. Jacobs
and Westwood together got this
done; and all the time I was keeping
my eyes fixed anxiously as man can
fancy, on the last gleams of the fire
ashore, as her head made a fairer line
with it; but, by little and little, it
went quite out, and all was black&mdash;though
I had taken its bearings
by the compass&mdash;and I kept her to
that for bare life, trembling at every
shiver in the foresail's edge, lest either
it or the mast should go.</p>

<p>Suddenly we began to get into a
fearful swell&mdash;the Indiaman plunged
and shook in every spar left her. I
could see nothing ahead, from the
wheel, and in the dark: we were getting
close in with the land, and the time
was coming; but still I held south-east-by-east
to the mark of her head
in the compass box, as nearly as might
and main could do if, for the heaves
that made me think once or twice
she was to strike next moment. If
she went ashore in my hands! why, it
was like to drive one mad with fear;
and I waited for Jacobs to come back,
with a brain ready to turn, almost as
if I'd have left the wheel to the other
helmsman, and run forward into the
bows to look out. The captain lay
raving, and shouting behind me, though
no one else could either have heard or
seen him; and where the chief officer
was all this time, surprised me, unless
the madman had made away with him,
or locked him in his own cabin, in return
for being shut up himself,&mdash;which
in fact proved to be the case, cunning
as it was to send for him so quietly. At
length Jacobs struggled aft to me again,
and charging him, for heaven's sake,
to steer exactly the course I gave, I
drove before the full strength of the
squall along-decks to the bowsprit,
where I held on and peered out.
Dead ahead of us was the high line of
coast in the dark&mdash;not a mile of swell
between the ship and it. By this time
the low boom of the surf came under
the wind, and you saw the breakers
lifting all along,&mdash;not a single opening
in them! I had lost sight of my landmarks,
and my heart gulped into my
mouth&mdash;what I felt 'twould be vain to
say,&mdash;till I thought I <i>did</i> make out
one short patch of sheer black in the
range of foam, scarce so far on our
bow as I'd reckoned the fire to have
been: indeed, instead of that, it was
rather on her weather than her lee
bow; and the more I watched it, and
the nearer we drove in that five minutes,
the broader it was. "By all
that's good!" I thought, "if a river
there is, that must be the mouth of
it!" But, by heavens! on our present
course, the ship would run just right
upon the point,&mdash;and, to strike the
clear water, her fore-yard would require
to be braced up, able or not,
though the force of the tornado would
come fearfully on her quarter, then.
There was the chance of taking all the
masts out of her; but let them stand
ten minutes, and the thing was done,
when we opened into the lee of the
points&mdash;otherwise all was over!</p>

<p>I sprang to the fore-braces and besought
the men near me, for God's sake,
to drag upon the lee one&mdash;and that as
if their life hung upon it&mdash;when Westwood
caught me by the arm. I merely
shouted through my hands into his
ear to go aft to Jacobs and tell him to
keep her head a <i>single point</i> up, whatever
might happen, to the last,&mdash;then
I pulled with the men at the brace till
it was fast, and scrambled up again to
the bowsprit heel. Jove! how she
surged to it: the little canvass we had
strained like to burst; the masts
trembled, and the spars aloft bent like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_740">740</span>
whip-shafts, everything below groaning
again; while the swell and the
blast together made you dizzy, as you
watched the white eddies rising and
boiling out of the dark&mdash;her cutwater
shearing through it and the foam, as if
you were going under it. The sound
of the hurricane and the surf seemed
to be growing together into one awful
roar,&mdash;my very brain began to turn
with the pitch I was wrought up to&mdash;and
it appeared next moment we
should heave far up into the savage
hubbub of breakers. I was wearying
for the crash and the wild confusion
that would follow&mdash;when all of a sudden,
still catching the fierce rush of
the gale athwart her quarter into the
fore-course, which steadied her though
she shuddered to it&mdash;all on a sudden
the dark mass of the land seemed as
it were parting ahead of her, and a
gleam of pale sky opened below the
dusk into my very face. I no more
knew what I was doing, by this time,
nor where we were, than the spar
before me,&mdash;till again, the light broadened,
glimmering low betwixt the high
land and a lump of rising level on the
other bow. I hurried aft past the
confused knots of men holding on to
the lee of the bulwarks, and seized a
spoke of the wheel. "Tom," shouted
I to Westwood, "run and let free the
spanker on the poop! Down with the
helm&mdash;down with it, Jacobs, my lad!"
I sang out; "never mind spars or
canvass!" Down went the helm&mdash;the
spanker helped to luff her to the
strength of the gust&mdash;and away she
went up to port, the heavy swells
rolling her in, while the rush into her
staysail and forecourse came in one
terrible flash of roaring wind,&mdash;tearing
first one and then the other clear out
of the belt-ropes, though the loose
spanker abaft was in less danger,
and the way she had from both was
enough to take her careening round
the point into its lee. By heavens!
there were the streaks of soft haze
low over the rising moon, under the
broken clouds, beyond a far line of
dim fringy woods, she herself just
tipping the hollow behind, big and red&mdash;when
right down from over the
cloud above us came a spout of rain,
then a sheet of it lifting to the blast
as it howled across the point. "Stand
by to let go the larboard anchor!" I
sang out through the trumpet; and
Jacobs put the helm fully down at the
moment, till she was coming head to
wind, when I made forward to the
mates and men. "Let&mdash;go!" I
shouted: not a look turned against
me, and away thundered the cable
through the hawse-hole; she shook
to it, sheered astern, and brought up
with her anchor fast. By that time
the rain was plashing down in a perfect
deluge&mdash;you couldn't see a yard
from you&mdash;all was one white pour of
it; although it soon began to drive
again over the headland, as the tornado
gathered new food out of it.
Another anchor was let go, cable payed
out, and the ship soon began to swing
the other way to the tide, pitching all
the while on the short swell.</p>

<p>The gale still whistled through her
spars for two or three hours, during
which it began by degrees to lull.
About eleven o'clock it was clear
moonlight to leeward, the air fresh and
cool: a delicious watch it was, too.
I was walking the poop by myself,
two or three men lounging sleepily
about the forecastle, and Rickett below
on the quarterdeck, when I saw
the chief officer himself rush up from
below, staring wildly round him, as
if he thought we were in some dream
or other. I fancied at first the mate
would have struck Rickett, from the
way he went on, but I kept aft where
I was. The eddies ran past the
Indiaman's side, and you heard the
fast ebb of the tide rushing and rippling
sweetly on her taut cables ahead,
plashing about the bows and bends.
We were in old Bob Martin's <i>river</i>,
whatever that might be.

<h2 id="THE_VISION_OF_SUDDEN_DEATH">THE VISION OF SUDDEN DEATH.</h2>

<p>[The reader is to understand this present paper, in its two sections of <i>The
Vision</i>, &amp;c., and <i>The Dream-Fugue</i>, as connected with a previous paper on
<i>The English Mail-Coach</i>, published in the Magazine for October. The ultimate
object was the Dream-Fugue, as an attempt to wrestle with the utmost
efforts of music in dealing with a colossal form of impassioned horror. The
Vision of Sudden Death contains the mail-coach incident, which did really
occur, and did really suggest the variations of the Dream, here taken up by
the Fugue, as well as other variations not now recorded. Confluent with
these impressions, from the terrific experience on the Manchester and Glasgow
mail, were other and more general impressions, derived from long familiarity
with the English mail, as developed in the former paper; impressions, for
instance, of animal beauty and power, of rapid motion, at that time unprecedented,
of connexion with the government and public business of a great
nation, but, above all, of connexion with the national victories at an unexampled
crisis,&mdash;the mail being the privileged organ for publishing and dispersing
all news of that kind. From this function of the mail, arises naturally the
introduction of Waterloo into the fourth variation of the Fugue; for the mail
itself having been carried into the dreams by the incident in the Vision, naturally
all the accessory circumstances of pomp and grandeur investing this
national carriage followed in the train of the principal image.]</p>

<p>What is to be thought of sudden
death? It is remarkable that, in different
conditions of society, it has
been variously regarded, as the consummation
of an earthly career most
fervently to be desired, and, on the
other hand, as that consummation
which is most of all to be deprecated.
Cæsar the Dictator, at his last dinner
party, (<i>cæna</i>,) and the very evening
before his assassination, being questioned
as to the mode of death which,
in <i>his</i> opinion, might seem the most
eligible, replied&mdash;"That which should
be most sudden." On the other
hand, the divine Litany of our English
Church, when breathing forth
supplications, as if in some representative
character for the whole human
race prostrate before God, places such
a death in the very van of horrors.
"From lightning and tempest; from
plague, pestilence, and famine; from
battle and murder, and from sudden
death,&mdash;<i>Good Lord, deliver us</i>."
Sudden death is here made to crown
the climax in a grand ascent of
calamities; it is the last of curses;
and yet, by the noblest of Romans, it
was treated as the first of blessings.
In that difference, most readers will
see little more than the difference between
Christianity and Paganism.
But there I hesitate. The Christian
church may be right in its estimate of
sudden death; and it is a natural
feeling, though after all it may also
be an infirm one, to wish for a quiet
dismissal from life&mdash;as that which
<i>seems</i> most reconcilable with meditation,
with penitential retrospects, and
with the humilities of farewell prayer.
There does not, however, occur to me
any direct scriptural warrant for this
earnest petition of the English Litany.
It seems rather a petition indulged to
human infirmity, than exacted from
human piety. And, however <i>that</i> may
be, two remarks suggest themselves
as prudent restraints upon a doctrine,
which else <i>may</i> wander, and <i>has</i> wandered,
into an uncharitable superstition.
The first is this: that many
people are likely to exaggerate the
horror of a sudden death, (I mean the
<i>objective</i> horror to him who contemplates
such a death, not the <i>subjective</i>
horror to him who suffers it)
from the false disposition to lay a
stress upon words or acts, simply
because by an accident they have
become words or acts. If a man
dies, for instance, by some sudden
death when he happens to be intoxicated,
such a death is falsely
regarded with peculiar horror; as
though the intoxication were suddenly
exalted into a blasphemy.
But <i>that</i> is unphilosophic. The man
was, or he was not, <i>habitually</i> a
drunkard. If not, if his intoxication
were a solitary accident, there can be
no reason at all for allowing special
emphasis to this act, simply because
through misfortune it became his final
act. Nor, on the other hand, if it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_742">742</span>
were no accident, but one of his
<i>habitual</i> transgressions, will it be the
more habitual or the more a transgression,
because some sudden calamity,
surprising him, has caused this
habitual transgression to be also a
final one? Could the man have had
any reason even dimly to foresee his
own sudden death, there would have
been a new feature in his act of intemperance&mdash;a
feature of presumption
and irreverence, as in one that by possibility
felt himself drawing near to
the presence of God. But this is no
part of the case supposed. And the
only new element in the man's act is
not any element of extra immorality,
but simply of extra misfortune.</p>

<p>The other remark has reference to
the meaning of the word <i>sudden</i>. And
it is a strong illustration of the duty
which for ever calls us to the stern
valuation of words&mdash;that very possibly
Cæsar and the Christian church
do not differ in the way supposed;
that is, do not differ by any difference
of doctrine as between Pagan
and Christian views of the moral
temper appropriate to death, but
that they are contemplating different
cases. Both contemplate a violent
death; a Βιαθανατος&mdash;death that is
Βιαιος: but the difference is&mdash;that the
Roman by the word "sudden" means
an <i>unlingering</i> death: whereas the
Christian litany by "sudden" means
a death <i>without warning</i>, consequently
without any available summons to
religious preparation. The poor mutineer,
who kneels down to gather
into his heart the bullets from twelve
firelocks of his pitying comrades, dies
by a most sudden death in Cæsar's
sense: one shock, one mighty spasm,
one (possibly <i>not</i> one) groan, and all
is over. But, in the sense of the
Litany, his death is far from sudden;
his offence originally, his imprisonment,
his trial, the interval between
his sentence and its execution, having
all furnished him with separate
warnings of his fate&mdash;having all
summoned him to meet it with solemn
preparation.</p>

<p>Meantime, whatever may be thought
of a sudden death as a mere variety
in the modes of dying, where death in
some shape is inevitable&mdash;a question
which, equally in the Roman and the
Christian sense, will be variously answered
according to each man's variety
of temperament&mdash;certainly, upon one
aspect of sudden death there can be
no opening for doubt, that of all
agonies incident to man it is the most
frightful, that of all martyrdoms it is
the most freezing to human sensibilities&mdash;namely,
where it surprises a man
under circumstances which offer (or
which seem to offer) some hurried and
inappreciable chance of evading it.
Any effort, by which such an evasion
can be accomplished, must be as
sudden as the danger which it affronts.
Even <i>that</i>, even the sickening necessity
for hurrying in extremity where
all hurry seems destined to be vain,
self-baffled, and where the dreadful
knell of <i>too late</i> is already sounding in
the ears by anticipation&mdash;even that
anguish is liable to a hideous exasperation
in one particular case, namely,
where the agonising appeal is made
not exclusively to the instinct of self-preservation,
but to the conscience, on
behalf of another life besides your own,
accidentally cast upon <i>your</i> protection.
To fail, to collapse in a service merely
your own, might seem comparatively
venial; though, in fact, it is far from
venial. But to fail in a case where
Providence has suddenly thrown into
your hands the final interests of another&mdash;of
a fellow-creature shuddering
between the gates of life and death;
this, to a man of apprehensive conscience,
would mingle the misery of an
atrocious criminality with the misery
of a bloody calamity. The man is
called upon, too probably, to die; but
to die at the very moment when, by
any momentary collapse, he is self-denounced
as a murderer. He had
but the twinkling of an eye for his
effort, and that effort might, at the
best, have been unavailing; but from
this shadow of a chance, small or
great, how if he has recoiled by a
treasonable <i>lâcheté</i>? The effort <i>might</i>
have been without hope; but to
have risen to the level of that
effort&mdash;would have rescued him,
though not from dying, yet from
dying as a traitor to his duties.</p>

<p>The situation here contemplated
exposes a dreadful ulcer, lurking far
down in the depths of human nature.
It is not that men generally are summoned
to face such awful trials. But
potentially, and in shadowy outline,
such a trial is moving subterraneously
in perhaps all men's natures&mdash;muttering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_743">743</span>
under ground in one world, to be
realised perhaps in some other. Upon
the secret mirror of our dreams such
a trial is darkly projected at intervals,
perhaps, to every one of us. That
dream, so familiar to childhood, of
meeting a lion, and, from languishing
prostration in hope and vital energy,
that constant sequel of lying down
before him, publishes the secret frailty
of human nature&mdash;reveals its deep-seated
Pariah falsehood to itself&mdash;records
its abysmal treachery. Perhaps
not one of us escapes that dream;
perhaps, as by some sorrowful doom
of man, that dream repeats for every
one of us, through every generation,
the original temptation in Eden.
Every one of us, in this dream, has a
bait offered to the infirm places of his
own individual will; once again a
snare is made ready for leading him
into captivity to a luxury of ruin;
again, as in aboriginal Paradise, the
man falls from innocence; once again,
by infinite iteration, the ancient Earth
groans to God, through her secret
caves, over the weakness of her child;
"Nature from her seat, sighing through
all her works," again "gives signs of
woe that all is lost;" and again the
counter sigh is repeated to the sorrowing
heavens of the endless rebellion
against God. Many people think that
one man, the patriarch of our race,
could not in his single person execute
this rebellion for all his race. Perhaps
they are wrong. But, even if not,
perhaps in the world of dreams every
one of us ratifies for himself the original
act. Our English rite of "Confirmation,"
by which, in years of
awakened reason, we take upon us
the engagements contracted for us in
our slumbering infancy,&mdash;how sublime
a rite is that! The little postern
gate, through which the baby in its
cradle had been silently placed for a
time within the glory of God's countenance,
suddenly rises to the clouds
as a triumphal arch, through which,
with banners displayed and martial
pomps, we make our second entry as
crusading soldiers militant for God,
by personal choice and by sacramental
oath. Each man says in effect&mdash;"Lo!
I rebaptise myself; and that
which once was sworn on my behalf,
now I swear for myself." Even so in
dreams, perhaps, under some secret
conflict of the midnight sleeper, lighted
up to the consciousness at the time,
but darkened to the memory as soon as
all is finished, each several child of our
mysterious race completes for himself
the aboriginal fall.</p>

<p>As I drew near to the Manchester
post-office, I found that it was considerably
past midnight; but to my
great relief, as it was important for
me to be in Westmorland by the
morning, I saw by the huge saucer
eyes of the mail, blazing through the
gloom of overhanging houses, that my
chance was not yet lost. Past the
time it was; but by some luck, very
unusual in my experience, the mail
was not even yet ready to start. I
ascended to my seat on the box, where
my cloak was still lying as it had lain
at the Bridgewater Arms. I had left
it there in imitation of a nautical discoverer,
who leaves a bit of bunting
on the shore of his discovery, by way
of warning off the ground the whole
human race, and signalising to the
Christian and the heathen worlds,
with his best compliments, that he
has planted his throne for ever upon
that virgin soil; henceforward claiming
the <i>jus dominii</i> to the top of the
atmosphere above it, and also the
right of driving shafts to the centre of
the earth below it; so that all people
found after this warning, either aloft
in the atmosphere, or in the shafts, or
squatting on the soil, will be treated
as trespassers&mdash;that is, decapitated by
their very faithful and obedient servant,
the owner of the said bunting.
Possibly my cloak might not have
been respected, and the <i>jus gentium</i>
might have been cruelly violated in
my person&mdash;for, in the dark, people
commit deeds of darkness, gas being
a great ally of morality&mdash;but it so
happened that, on this night, there was
no other outside passenger; and the
crime, which else was but too probable,
missed fire for want of a criminal.
By the way, I may as well
mention at this point, since a circumstantial
accuracy is essential to the
effect of my narrative, that there was
no other person of any description
whatever about the mail&mdash;the guard,
the coachman, and myself being
allowed for&mdash;except only one&mdash;a horrid
creature of the class known to the
world as insiders, but whom young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">744</span>
Oxford called sometimes "Trojans,"
in opposition to our Grecian selves,
and sometimes "vermin." A Turkish
Effendi, who piques himself on good-breeding,
will never mention by name
a pig. Yet it is but too often that
he has reason to mention this animal;
since constantly, in the streets of
Stamboul, he has his trousers deranged
or polluted by this vile creature running
between his legs. But under
any excess of hurry he is always careful,
out of respect to the company he
is dining with, to suppress the odious
name, and to call the wretch "that
other creature," as though all animal
life beside formed one group, and this
odious beast (to whom, as Chrysippus
observed, salt serves as an apology
for a soul) formed another and alien
group on the outside of creation.
Now I, who am an English Effendi,
that think myself to understand good-breeding
as well as any son of Othman,
beg my reader's pardon for having
mentioned an insider by his gross
natural name. I shall do so no more:
and, if I should have occasion to
glance at so painful a subject, I shall
always call him "that other creature."
Let us hope, however, that no such
distressing occasion will arise. But,
by the way, an occasion arises at this
moment; for the reader will be sure
to ask, when we come to the story,
"Was this other creature present?"
He was <i>not</i>; or more correctly, perhaps,
<i>it</i> was not. We dropped the
creature&mdash;or the creature, by natural
imbecility, dropped itself&mdash;within the
first ten miles from Manchester. In
the latter case, I wish to make a
philosophic remark of a moral tendency.
When I die, or when the
reader dies, and by repute suppose of
fever, it will never be known whether
we died in reality of the fever or of
the doctor. But this other creature,
in the ease of dropping out of the
coach, will enjoy a coroner's inquest;
consequently he will enjoy an epitaph.
For I insist upon it, that the verdict
of a coroner's jury makes the best of
epitaphs. It is brief, so that the
public all find time to read it; it is
pithy, so that the surviving friends
(if any <i>can</i> survive such a loss) remember
it without fatigue; it is upon
oath, so that rascals and Dr Johnsons
cannot pick holes in it. "Died through
the visitation of intense stupidity, by
impinging on a moonlight night against
the off hind wheel of the Glasgow mail!
Deodand upon the said wheel&mdash;two-pence."
What a simple lapidary
inscription! Nobody much in the
wrong but an off-wheel; and with few
acquaintances; and if it were but
rendered into choice Latin, though
there would be a little bother in finding
a Ciceronian word for "off-wheel,"
Marcellus himself, that great master
of sepulchral eloquence, could not
show a better. Why I call this little
remark <i>moral</i>, is, from the compensation
it points out. Here, by the
supposition, is that other creature on
the one side, the beast of the world;
and he (or it) gets an epitaph. You
and I, on the contrary, the pride of
our friends, get none.</p>

<p>But why linger on the subject of
vermin? Having mounted the box, I
took a small quantity of laudanum,
having already travelled two hundred
and fifty miles&mdash;viz., from a point
seventy miles beyond London, upon a
simple breakfast. In the taking of
laudanum there was nothing extraordinary.
But by accident it drew upon
me the special attention of my assessor
on the box, the coachman. And
in <i>that</i> there was nothing extraordinary.
But by accident, and with
great delight, it drew my attention to
the fact that this coachman was a
monster in point of size, and that he
had but one eye. In fact he had been
foretold by Virgil as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>He answered in every point&mdash;a monster
he was&mdash;dreadful, shapeless, huge,
who had lost an eye. But why should
<i>that</i> delight me? Had he been one of
the Calendars in the Arabian Nights,
and had paid down his eye as the
price of his criminal curiosity, what
right had <i>I</i> to exult in his misfortune?
I did <i>not</i> exult: I delighted in no
man's punishment, though it were
even merited. But these personal
distinctions identified in an instant an
old friend of mine, whom I had known
in the south for some years as the most
masterly of mail-coachmen. He was
the man in all Europe that could best
have undertaken to drive six-in-hand
full gallop over <i>Al Sirat</i>&mdash;that famous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">745</span>
bridge of Mahomet across the bottomless
gulf, backing himself against the
Prophet and twenty such fellows. I
used to call him <i>Cyclops mastigophorus</i>,
Cyclops the whip-bearer, until I observed
that his skill made whips useless,
except to fetch off an impertinent
fly from a leader's head; upon which
I changed his Grecian name to Cyclops
<i>diphrélates</i> (Cyclops the charioteer.)
I, and others known to me, studied
under him the diphrelatic art. Excuse,
reader, a word too elegant to be
pedantic. And also take this remark
from me, as a <i>gage d'amitié</i>&mdash;that
no word ever was or <i>can</i> be pedantic
which, by supporting a distinction, supports
the accuracy of logic; or which
fills up a chasm for the understanding.
As a pupil, though I paid extra fees,
I cannot say that I stood high in his
esteem. It showed his dogged honesty,
(though, observe, not his discernment,)
that he could not see my
merits. Perhaps we ought to excuse
his absurdity in this particular by remembering
his want of an eye. <i>That</i>
made him blind to my merits. Irritating
as this blindness was, (surely
it could not be envy?) he always
courted my conversation, in which art
I certainly had the whip-hand of him.
On this occasion, great joy was at our
meeting. But what was Cyclops doing
here? Had the medical men recommended
northern air, or how? I
collected, from such explanations as
he volunteered, that he had an interest
at stake in a suit-at-law pending at
Lancaster; so that probably he had
got himself transferred to this station,
for the purpose of connecting with his
professional pursuits an instant readiness
for the calls of his law-suit.</p>

<p>Meantime, what are we stopping
for? Surely we've been waiting long
enough. Oh, this procrastinating
mail, and oh this procrastinating post-office!
Can't they take a lesson upon
that subject from <i>me</i>? Some people
have called <i>me</i> procrastinating. Now
you are witness, reader, that I was
in time for <i>them</i>. But can <i>they</i> lay
their hands on their hearts, and say
that they were in time for me? I,
during my life, have often had to wait
for the post-office: the post-office
never waited a minute for me. What
are they about? The guard tells me
that there is a large extra accumulation
of foreign mails this night, owing
to irregularities caused by war and by
the packet-service, when as yet nothing
is done by steam. For an <i>extra</i>
hour, it seems, the post-office has
been engaged in threshing out the
pure wheaten correspondence of Glasgow,
and winnowing it from the chaff
of all baser intermediate towns. We
can hear the flails going at this
moment. But at last all is finished.
Sound your horn, guard. Manchester,
good bye; we've lost an hour by
your criminal conduct at the post-office:
which, however, though I do
not mean to part with a serviceable
ground of complaint, and one which
really <i>is</i> such for the horses, to me
secretly is an advantage, since it compels
us to recover this last hour
amongst the next eight or nine. Off
we are at last, and at eleven miles
an hour: and at first I detect no
changes in the energy or in the
of Cyclops.</p>

<p>From Manchester to Kendal, which
virtually (though not in law) is the
capital of Westmoreland, were at this
time seven stages of eleven miles each.
The first five of these, dated from
Manchester, terminated in Lancaster,
which was therefore fifty-five miles
north of Manchester, and the same
distance exactly from Liverpool. The
first three terminated in Preston
(called, by way of distinction from
other towns of that name, <i>proud</i> Preston,)
at which place it was that the
separate roads from Liverpool and
from Manchester to the north became
confluent. Within these first three
stages lay the foundation, the progress,
and termination of our night's adventure.
During the first stage, I found
out that Cyclops was mortal: he was
liable to the shocking affection of
sleep&mdash;a thing which I had never previously
suspected. If a man is addicted
to the vicious habit of sleeping, all
the skill in aurigation of Apollo himself,
with the horses of Aurora to execute
the motions of his will, avail him
nothing. "Oh, Cyclops!" I exclaimed
more than once, "Cyclops, my
friend; thou art mortal. Thou snorest."
Through this first eleven miles,
however, he betrayed his infirmity&mdash;which
I grieve to say he shared with
the whole Pagan Pantheon&mdash;only by
short stretches. On waking up, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_746">746</span>
made an apology for himself, which,
instead of mending the matter, laid an
ominous foundation for coming disasters.
The summer assizes were
now proceeding at Lancaster: in consequence
of which, for three nights
and three days, he had not lain down
in a bed. During the day, he was
waiting for his uncertain summons as
a witness on the trial in which he
was interested; or he was drinking
with the other witnesses, under the
vigilant surveillance of the attorneys.
During the night, or that part of it
when the least temptations existed to
conviviality, he was driving. Throughout
the second stage he grew more
and more drowsy. In the second
mile of the third stage, he surrendered
himself finally and without a struggle
to his perilous temptation. All his
past resistance had but deepened the
weight of this final oppression. Seven
atmospheres of sleep seemed resting
upon him; and, to consummate the
case, our worthy guard, after singing
"Love amongst the Roses," for the
fiftieth or sixtieth time, without any
invitation from Cyclops or myself,
and without applause for his poor
labours, had moodily resigned himself
to slumber&mdash;not so deep doubtless as
the coachman's, but deep enough for
mischief; and having, probably, no
similar excuse. And thus at last,
about ten miles from Preston, I found
myself left in charge of his Majesty's
London and Glasgow mail then running
about eleven miles an hour.</p>

<p>What made this negligence less
criminal than else it must have been
thought, was the condition of the roads
at night during the assizes. At that
time all the law business of populous
Liverpool, and of populous Manchester,
with its vast cincture of populous
rural districts, was called up by ancient
usage to the tribunal of Lilliputian
Lancaster. To break up this old
traditional usage required a conflict
with powerful established interests, a
large system of new arrangements, and
a new parliamentary statute. As
things were at present, twice in the
year so vast a body of business rolled
northwards, from the southern quarter
of the county, that a fortnight at
least occupied the severe exertions of
two judges for its despatch. The
consequence of this was&mdash;that every
horse available for such a service, along
the whole line of road, was exhausted
in carrying down the multitudes of
people who were parties to the different
suits. By sunset, therefore, it
usually happened that, through utter
exhaustion amongst men and horses,
the roads were all silent. Except
exhaustion in the vast adjacent county
of York from a contested election,
nothing like it was ordinarily witnessed
in England.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the usual silence
and solitude prevailed along the road.
Not a hoof nor a wheel was to be
heard. And to strengthen this false
luxurious confidence in the noiseless
roads, it happened also that the night
was one of peculiar solemnity and
peace. I myself, though slightly
alive to the possibilities of peril, had
so far yielded to the influence of the
mighty calm as to sink into a profound
reverie. The month was August,
in which lay my own birth-day;
a festival to every thoughtful man
suggesting solemn and often sigh-born
thoughts.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> The county was my
own native county&mdash;upon which, in its
southern section, more than upon any
equal area known to man past or
present, had descended the original
curse of labour in its heaviest form,
not mastering the bodies of men only
as of slaves, or criminals in mines,
but working through the fiery will.
Upon no equal space of earth, was, or
ever had been, the same energy of
human power put forth daily. At
this particular season also of the
assizes, that dreadful hurricane of
flight and pursuit, as it might have
seemed to a stranger, that swept to
and from Lancaster all day long,
hunting the county up and down, and
regularly subsiding about sunset,
united with the permanent distinction
of Lancashire as the very metropolis
and citadel of labour, to point the
thoughts pathetically upon that
counter vision of rest, of saintly repose
from strife and sorrow, towards
which, as to their secret haven, the
profounder aspirations of man's heart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_747">747</span>
are continually travelling. Obliquely
we were nearing the sea upon our
left, which also must, under the present
circumstances, be repeating the
general state of halcyon repose. The
sea, the atmosphere, the light, bore
an orchestral part in this universal
lull. Moonlight, and the first timid
tremblings of the dawn, were now
blending; and the blendings were
brought into a still more exquisite
state of unity, by a slight silvery
mist, motionless and dreamy, that
covered the woods and fields, but
with a veil of equable transparency.
Except the feet of our own horses,
which, running on a sandy margin of
the road, made little disturbance,
there was no sound abroad. In the
clouds, and on the earth, prevailed
the same majestic peace; and in spite
of all that the villain of a schoolmaster
has done for the ruin of our sublimer
thoughts, which are the thoughts of
our infancy, we still believe in no
such nonsense as a limited atmosphere.
Whatever we may swear
with our false feigning lips, in our
faithful hearts we still believe, and
must for ever believe, in fields of air
traversing the total gulf between
earth and the central heavens. Still,
in the confidence of children that
tread without fear <i>every</i> chamber in
their father's house, and to whom no
door is closed, we, in that Sabbatic
vision which sometimes is revealed
for an hour upon nights like this,
ascend with easy steps from the sorrow-stricken
fields of earth, upwards
to the sandals of God.</p>

<p>Suddenly from thoughts like these,
I was awakened to a sullen sound, as
of some motion on the distant road.
It stole upon the air for a moment;
I listened in awe; but then it died
away. Once roused, however, I
could not but observe with alarm the
quickened motion of our horses. Ten
years' experience had made my eye
learned in the valuing of motion; and
I saw that we were now running
thirteen miles an hour. I pretend to
no presence of mind. On the contrary,
my fear is, that I am miserably
and shamefully deficient in that quality
as regards action. The palsy of
doubt and distraction hangs like some
guilty weight of dark unfathomed remembrances
upon my energies, when
the signal is flying for <i>action</i>. But,
on the other hand, this accursed gift
I have, as regards <i>thought</i>, that in the
first step towards the possibility of a
misfortune, I see its total evolution:
in the radix, I see too certainly and
too instantly its entire expansion; in
the first syllable of the dreadful
sentence, I read already the last. It
was not that I feared for ourselves.
What could injure <i>us</i>? Our bulk and
impetus charmed us against peril in
any collision. And I had rode
through too many hundreds of perils
that were frightful to approach, that
were matter of laughter as we looked
back upon them, for any anxiety to
rest upon <i>our</i> interests. The mail
was not built, I felt assured, nor bespoke,
that could betray <i>me</i> who
trusted to its protection. But any
carriage that we could meet would be
frail and light in comparison of ourselves.
And I remarked this ominous
accident of our situation. We were
on the wrong side of the road. But
then the other party, if other there
was, might also be on the wrong
side; and two wrongs might make a
right. <i>That</i> was not likely. The
same motive which had drawn <i>us</i> to
the right-hand side of the road, viz.,
the soft beaten sand, as contrasted
with the paved centre, would prove
attractive to others. Our lamps, still
lighted, would give the impression of
vigilance on our part. And every
creature that met us, would rely upon
<i>us</i> for quartering.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> All this, and if
the separate links of the anticipation
had been a thousand times more, I
saw&mdash;not discursively or by effort&mdash;but
as by one flash of horrid intuition.</p>

<p>Under this steady though rapid
anticipation of the evil which <i>might</i>
be gathering ahead, ah, reader! what
a sullen mystery of fear, what a sigh
of woe, seemed to steal upon the air,
as again the far-off sound of a wheel
was heard! A whisper it was&mdash;a
whisper from, perhaps, four miles off&mdash;secretly
announcing a ruin that,
being foreseen, was not the less inevitable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_748">748</span>
What could be done&mdash;who was
it that could do it&mdash;to check the
storm-flight of these maniacal horses?
What! could I not seize the reins
from the grasp of the slumbering coachman?
You, reader, think that it
would have been in <i>your</i> power to do
so. And I quarrel not with your
estimate of yourself. But, from the
way in which the coachman's hand
was viced between his upper and lower
thigh, this was impossible. The guard
subsequently found it impossible, after
this danger had passed. Not the
grasp only, but also the position of this
Polyphemus, made the attempt impossible.
You still think otherwise.
See, then, that bronze equestrian
statue. The cruel rider has kept the
bit in his horse's mouth for two centuries.
Unbridle him, for a minute,
if you please, and wash his mouth
with water. Or stay, reader, unhorse
me that marble emperor: knock me
those marble feet from those marble
stirrups of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>The sounds ahead strengthened,
and were now too clearly the sounds of
wheels. Who and what could it be?
Was it industry in a taxed cart?&mdash;was
it youthful gaiety in a gig? Whoever
it was, something must be attempted
to warn them. Upon the other party
rests the active responsibility, but
upon <i>us</i>&mdash;and, woe is me! that <i>us</i>
was my single self&mdash;rests the responsibility
of warning. Yet, how should
this be accomplished? Might I not
seize the guard's horn? Already, on
the first thought, I was making my
way over the roof to the guard's seat.
But this, from the foreign mails being
piled upon the roof, was a difficult,
and even dangerous attempt, to one
cramped by nearly three hundred
miles of outside travelling. And,
fortunately, before I had lost much
time in the attempt, our frantic horses
swept round an angle of the road,
which opened upon us the stage where
the collision must be accomplished,
the parties that seemed summoned to
the trial, and the impossibility of saving
them by any communication with
the guard.</p>

<p>Before us lay an avenue, straight
as an arrow, hundred yards, perhaps,
in length; and the umbrageous
trees, which rose in a regular line
from either side, meeting high overhead,
gave to it the character of a
cathedral aisle. These trees lent a
deeper solemnity to the early light;
but there was still light enough to
perceive, at the further end of this
gothic aisle, a light, reedy gig, in
which were seated a young man, and,
by his side, a young lady. Ah, young
sir! what are you about? If it is
necessary that you should whisper
your communications to this young
lady&mdash;though really I see, nobody at
this hour, and on this solitary road,
likely to overhear your conversation&mdash;is
it, therefore, necessary that you
should carry your lips forward to hers?
The little carriage is creeping on at
one mile an hour; and the parties
within it, being thus tenderly engaged,
are naturally bending down their
heads. Between them and eternity,
to all human calculation, there is but
a minute and a half. What is it that
I shall do? Strange it is, and to a
mere auditor of the tale, might seem
laughable, that I should need a suggestion
from the <i>Iliad</i> to prompt the
sole recourse that remained. But
so it was. Suddenly I remembered
the shout of Achilles, and its effect.
But could I pretend to shout like the
son of Peleus, aided by Pallas? No,
certainly: but then I needed not the
shout that should alarm all Asia militant;
a shout would suffice, such as
should carry terror into the hearts of
two thoughtless young people, and one
gig horse. I shouted&mdash;and the young
man heard me not. A second time I
shouted&mdash;and now he heard me, for
now he raised his head.</p>

<p>Here, then, all had been done that,
by me, <i>could</i> be done: more on <i>my</i>
part was not possible. Mine had been
the first step: the second was for the
young man: the third was for God.
If, said I, the stranger is a brave
man, and if, indeed, he loves the
young girl at his side&mdash;or, loving her
not, if he feels the obligation pressing
upon every man worthy to be called
a man, of doing his utmost for a woman
confided to his protection&mdash;he
will at least make some effort to save
her. If <i>that</i> fails, he will not perish
the more, or by a death more cruel, for
having made it; and he will die, as
a brave man should, with his face to
the danger, and with his arm about the
woman that he sought in vain to save.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_749">749</span>
But if he makes no effort, shrinking,
without a struggle, from his duty, he
himself will not the less certainly
perish for this baseness of poltroonery.
He will die no less: and why not?
Wherefore should we grieve that there
is one craven less in the world? No;
<i>let</i> him perish, without a pitying
thought of ours wasted upon him;
and, in that case, all our grief will be
reserved for the fate of the helpless
girl, who, now, upon the least shadow
of failure in <i>him</i>, must, by the fiercest
of translations&mdash;must, without time
for a prayer&mdash;must, within seventy
seconds, stand before the judgment-seat
of God.</p>

<p>But craven he was not: sudden
had been the call upon him, and
sudden was his answer to the call.
He saw, he heard, he comprehended,
the ruin that was coming down: already
its gloomy shadow darkened
above him; and already he was measuring
his strength to deal with it.
Ah! what a vulgar thing does courage
seem, when we see nations buying it
and selling it for a shilling a-day: ah!
what a sublime thing does courage
seem, when some fearful crisis on the
great deeps of life carries a man, as
if running before a hurricane, up to the
giddy crest of some mountainous wave,
from which, accordingly as he chooses
his course, he descries two courses,
and a voice says to him audibly&mdash;"This
way lies hope; take the other
way and mourn for ever!" Yet, even
then, amidst the raving of the seas
and the frenzy of the danger, the man
is able to confront his situation&mdash;is
able to retire for a moment into solitude
with God, and to seek all his
counsel from <i>him</i>! For seven seconds,
it might be, of his seventy, the stranger
settled his countenance steadfastly
upon us, as if to search and value
every element in the conflict before
him. For five seconds more he sate
immovably, like one that mused on
some great purpose. For five he sate
with eyes upraised, like one that prayed
in sorrow, under some extremity of
doubt, for wisdom to guide him towards
the better choice. Then suddenly
he rose; stood upright; and,
by a sudden strain upon the reins,
raising his horse's forefeet from the
ground, he slewed him round on the
pivot of his hind legs, so as to plant
the little equipage in a position nearly
at right-angles to ours. Thus far his
condition was not improved; except
as a first step had been taken towards
the possibility of a second. If no
more were done, nothing was done;
for the little carriage still occupied
the very centre of our path, though
in an altered direction. Yet even
now it may not be too late: fifteen
of the twenty seconds may still be
unexhausted; and one almighty bound
forward may avail to clear the ground.
Hurry then, hurry! for the flying moments&mdash;<i>they</i>
hurry! Oh hurry, hurry,
my brave young man! for the cruel
hoofs of our horses&mdash;<i>they</i> also hurry!
Fast are the flying moments, faster
are the hoofs of our horses. Fear not
for <i>him</i>, if human energy can suffice:
faithful was he that drove, to his
terrific duty; faithful was the horse
to <i>his</i> command. One blow, one
impulse given with voice and hand
by the stranger, one rush from the
horse, one bound as if in the act of
rising to a fence, landed the docile
creature's fore-feet upon the crown or
arching centre of the road. The
larger half of the little equipage had
then cleared our over-towering shadow:
<i>that</i> was evident even to my own
agitated sight. But it mattered little
that one wreck should float off in
safety, if upon the wreck that perished
were embarked the human
freightage. The rear part of the
carriage&mdash;was <i>that</i> certainly beyond
the line of absolute ruin? What power
could answer the question? Glance
of eye, thought of man, wing of angel,
which of these had speed enough to
sweep between the question and the
answer, and divide the one from the
other? Light does not tread upon
the steps of light more indivisibly,
than did our all-conquering arrival
upon the escaping efforts of the gig.
<i>That</i> must the young man have felt
too plainly. His back was now turned
to us; not by sight could he any
longer communicate with the peril;
but by the dreadful rattle of our harness,
too truly had his ear been instructed&mdash;that
all was finished as
regarded any further effort of <i>his</i>.
Already in resignation he had rested
from his struggle; and perhaps, in his
heart he was whispering&mdash;"Father,
which art above, do thou finish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_750">750</span>
in heaven what I on earth have
attempted." We ran past them
faster than ever mill-race in our
inexorable flight. Oh, raving of
hurricanes that must have sounded in
their young ears at the moment of
our transit! Either with the swingle-bar,
or with the haunch of our near
leader, we had struck the off-wheel of
the little gig, which stood rather
obliquely and not quite so far advanced
as to be accurately parallel with the
near wheel. The blow, from the
fury of our passage, resounded terrifically.
I rose in horror, to look upon
the ruins we might have caused.
From my elevated station I looked
down, and looked back upon the scene,
which in a moment told its tale, and
wrote all its records on my heart for
ever.</p>

<p>The horse was planted immovably,
with his fore-feet upon the paved
crest of the central road. He of the
whole party was alone untouched by
the passion of death. The little
cany carriage&mdash;partly perhaps from
the dreadful torsion of the wheels in
its recent movement, partly from the
thundering blow we had given to it&mdash;as
if it sympathised with human
horror, was all alive with tremblings
and shiverings. The young man sat
like a rock. He stirred not at all.
But <i>his</i> was the steadiness of agitation
frozen into rest by horror. As yet
he dared not to look round; for he
knew that, if anything remained to
do, by him it could no longer be done.
And as yet he knew not for certain if
their safety were accomplished. But
the lady&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But the lady&mdash;&mdash;! Oh heavens! will
that spectacle ever depart from my
dreams, as she rose and sank upon her
seat, sank and rose, threw up her arms
wildly to heaven, clutched at some
visionary object in the air, fainting,
praying, raving, despairing! Figure to
yourself, reader, the elements of the
case; suffer me to recall before your
mind the circumstances of the unparalleled
situation. From the silence
and deep peace of this saintly summer
night,&mdash;from the pathetic blending
of this sweet moonlight, dawnlight,
dreamlight,&mdash;from the manly tenderness
of this flattering, whispering,
murmuring love,&mdash;suddenly as from
the woods and fields,&mdash;suddenly as
from the chambers of the air opening
in revelation,&mdash;suddenly as from the
ground yawning at her feet, leaped
upon her, with the flashing of cataracts,
Death the crownèd phantom,
with all the equipage of his terrors,
and the tiger roar of his voice.</p>

<p>The moments were numbered. In
the twinkling of an eye our flying
horses had carried us to the termination
of the umbrageous aisle; at right-angles
we wheeled into our former
direction; the turn of the road carried
the scene out of my eyes in an instant,
and swept it into my dreams for
ever.</p>

<h3>1.</h3>

<p>Lo, it is summer, almighty summer!
The everlasting gates of life and summer
are thrown open wide; and on
the ocean, tranquil and verdant as a
savannah, the unknown lady from the
dreadful vision and I myself are floating:
she upon a fairy pinnace, and I
upon an English three-decker. But
both of us are wooing gales of festal
happiness within the domain of our
common country&mdash;within that ancient
watery park&mdash;within that pathless
chase where England takes her pleasure
as a huntress through winter and
summer, and which stretches from the
rising to the setting sun. Ah! what
a wilderness of floral beauty was hidden,
or was suddenly revealed, upon
the tropic islands through which the
pinnace moved. And upon her deck
what a bevy of human flowers&mdash;young
women how lovely, young men how
noble, that were dancing together, and
slowly drifting towards <i>us</i> amidst
music and incense, amidst blossoms
from forests and gorgeous corymbi
from vintages, amidst natural caroling
and the echoes of sweet girlish laughter.
Slowly the pinnace nears us,
gaily she hails us, and slowly she disappears
beneath the shadow of our
mighty bows. But then, as at some
signal from heaven, the music and the
carols, and the sweet echoing of girlish
laughter&mdash;all are hushed. What
evil has smitten the pinnace, meeting
or overtaking her? Did ruin to our
friends couch within our own dreadful
shadow? Was our shadow the shadow
of death? I looked over the
bow for an answer; and, behold! the
pinnace was dismantled; the revel and
the revellers were found no more; the
glory of the vintage was dust; and the
forest was left without a witness to its
beauty upon the seas. "But where,"
and I turned to our own crew&mdash;"where
are the lovely women that danced
beneath the awning of flowers and
clustering corymbi? Whither have
fled the noble young men that danced
with <i>them</i>?" Answer there was none.
But suddenly the man at the mast-head,
whose countenance darkened
with alarm, cried aloud&mdash;"Sail on the
weather-beam! Down she comes
upon us; in seventy seconds she will
founder!"</p>

<h3>2.</h3>

<p>I looked to the weather-side, and
the summer had departed. The sea
was rocking, and shaken with gathering
wrath. Upon its surface sate
mighty mists, which grouped themselves
into arches and long cathedral
aisles. Down one of these, with the
fiery pace of a quarrel from a crossbow,
ran a frigate right athwart our
course. "Are they mad?" some
voice exclaimed from our deck. "Are
they blind? Do they woo their ruin?"
But in a moment, as she was close upon
us, some impulse of a heady current
or sudden vortex gave a wheeling bias
to her course, and off she forged without
a shock. As she ran past us,
high aloft amongst the shrouds stood
the lady of the pinnace. The deeps
opened ahead in malice to receive
her, towering surges of foam ran after
her, the billows were fierce to catch
her. But far away she was borne
into desert spaces of the sea: whilst
still by sight I followed her, as she ran
before the howling gale, chased by
angry sea-birds and by maddening
billows; still I saw her, as at the moment
when she ran past us, amongst
the shrouds, with her white draperies
streaming before the wind. There she
stood with hair dishevelled, one hand
clutched amongst the tackling&mdash;rising,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">752</span>
sinking, fluttering, trembling, praying&mdash;there
for leagues I saw her as
she stood, raising at intervals one
hand to heaven, amidst the fiery crests
of the pursuing waves and the raving
of the storm; until at last, upon a
sound from afar of malicious laughter
and mockery, all was hidden for ever
in driving showers; and afterwards,
but when I know not, and how I know
not.</p>

<h3>3.</h3>

<p>Sweet funeral bells from some incalculable
distance, wailing over the
dead that die before the dawn,
awakened me as I slept in a boat
moored to some familiar shore. The
morning twilight even then was
breaking; and, by the dusky revelations
which it spread, I saw a girl
adorned with a garland of white
roses about her head for some great
festival, running along the solitary
strand with extremity of haste. Her
running was the running of panic;
and often she looked back as to some
dreadful enemy in the rear. But when
I leaped ashore, and followed on her
steps to warn her of a peril in front,
alas! from me she fled as from another
peril; and vainly I shouted to her of
quicksands that lay ahead. Faster
and faster she ran; round a promontory
of rock she wheeled out of sight;
in an instant I also wheeled round it,
but only to see the treacherous sands
gathering above her head. Already
her person was buried; only the fair
young head and the diadem of white
roses around it were still visible to
the pitying heavens; and, last of all,
was visible one marble arm. I saw
by the early twilight this fair young
head, as it was sinking down to darkness&mdash;saw
this marble arm, as it rose
above her head and her treacherous
grave, tossing, faultering, rising,
clutching as at some false deceiving
hand stretched out from the clouds&mdash;saw
this marble arm uttering her dying
hope, and then her dying despair. The
head, the diadem, the arm,&mdash;these
all had sunk, at last over these also
the cruel quicksand had closed; and
no memorial of the fair young girl
remained on earth, except my own
solitary tears, and the funeral bells
from the desert seas, that, rising
again more softly, sang a requiem
over the grave of the buried child,
and over her blighted dawn.</p>

<p>I sate, and wept in secret the tears
that men have ever given to the memory
of those that died before the
dawn, and by the treachery of earth,
our mother. But the tears and funeral
bells were hushed suddenly by a shout
as of many nations, and by a roar
as from some great king's artillery advancing
rapidly along the valleys, and
heard afar by its echoes among the
mountains. "Hush!" I said, as I
bent my car earthwards to listen&mdash;"hush!&mdash;this
either is the very
anarchy of strife, or else"&mdash;and then
I listened more profoundly, and said as
I raised my head&mdash;"or else, oh heavens!
it is <i>victory</i> that swallows up
all strife."</p>

<h3>4.</h3>

<p>Immediately, in trance, I was carried
over land and sea to some distant
kingdom, and placed upon a triumphal
car, amongst companions crowned
with laurel. The darkness of gathering
midnight, brooding over all the
land, bid from us the mighty crowds
that were weaving restlessly about our
carriage as a centre&mdash;we heard them,
but we saw them not. Tidings had
arrived, within an hour, of a grandeur
that measured itself against centuries;
too full of pathos they were, too full
of joy that acknowledged no fountain
but God, to utter themselves by other
language than by tears, by restless
anthems, by reverberations rising
from every choir, of the <i>Gloria in
excelsis</i>. These tidings we that sate
upon the laurelled car had it for
our privilege to publish amongst all
nations. And already, by signs
audible through the darkness, by
snortings and tramplings, our angry
horses, that knew no fear of
fleshly weariness, upbraided us with
delay. Wherefore <i>was</i> it that we
delayed? We waited for a secret
word, that should bear witness to the
hope of nations, as now accomplished
for ever. At midnight the secret
word arrived; which word was&mdash;Waterloo
and Recovered Christendom!
The dreadful word shone by
its own light; before us it went;
high above our leaders' heads it rode,
and spread a golden light over the
paths which we traversed. Every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_753">753</span>
city, at the presence of the secret
word, threw open its gates to receive
us. The rivers were silent as we
crossed. All the infinite forests, as
we ran along their margins, shivered
in homage to the secret word. And
the darkness comprehended it.</p>

<p>Two hours after midnight we reached
a mighty minster. Its gates, which
rose to the clouds, were closed. But
when the dreadful word, that rode
before us, reached them with its
golden light, silently they moved
back upon their hinges; and at a
flying gallop our equipage entered the
grand aisle of the cathedral. Headlong
was our pace; and at every altar,
in the little chapels and oratories
to the right hand and left of our
course, the lamps, dying or sickening,
kindled anew in sympathy with the
secret word that was flying past.
Forty leagues we might have run in
the cathedral, and as yet no strength
of morning light had reached us, when
we saw before us the aerial galleries
of the organ and the choir. Every
pinnacle of the fret-work, every station
of advantage amongst the traceries,
was crested by white-robed
choristers, that sang deliverance; that
wept no more tears, as once their
fathers had wept; but at intervals
that sang together to the generations,
saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Chaunt the deliverer's praise in every tongue,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>and receiving answers from afar,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----"such as once in heaven and earth were sung."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And of their chaunting was no end; of
our headlong pace was neither pause
nor remission.</p>

<p>Thus, as we ran like torrents&mdash;thus,
as we swept with bridal rapture over
the Campo Santo<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> of the cathedral
graves&mdash;suddenly we became aware
of a vast necropolis rising upon the
far-off horizon&mdash;a city of sepulchres,
built within the saintly cathedral for
the warrior dead that rested from
their feuds on earth. Of purple granite
was the necropolis; yet, in the
first minute, it lay like a purple stain
upon the horizon&mdash;so mighty was the
distance. In the second minute it
trembled through many changes,
growing into terraces and towers of
wondrous altitude, so mighty was the
pace. In the third minute already,
with our dreadful gallop, we were
entering its suburbs. Vast sarcophagi
rose on every side, having
towers and turrets that, upon the
limits of the central aisle, strode forward
with haughty intrusion, that ran
back with mighty shadows into answering
recesses. Every sarcophagus
showed many bas-reliefs&mdash;bas-reliefs
of battles&mdash;bas-reliefs of battle-fields;
of battles from forgotten ages&mdash;of
battles from yesterday&mdash;of battle-fields
that, long since, nature had
healed and reconciled to herself with
the sweet oblivion of flowers&mdash;of battle-fields
that were yet angry and
crimson with carnage. Where the terraces
ran, there did <i>we</i> run; where the
towers curved, there did <i>we</i> curve.
With the flight of swallows our horses,
swept round every angle. Like rivers
in flood, wheeling round headlands;
like hurricanes that ride into the secrets
of forests; faster than ever light
unwove the mazes of darkness, our
flying equipage carried earthly passions&mdash;kindled
warrior instincts&mdash;amongst
the dust that lay around us;
dust oftentimes of our noble fathers
that had slept in God from Créci to
Trafalgar. And now had we reached
the last sarcophagus, now were we
abreast of the last bas-relief, already
had we recovered the arrow-like flight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_754">754</span>
of the illimitable central aisle, when
coming up this aisle to meet us we beheld
a female infant that rode in a carriage
as frail as flowers. The mists,
which went before her, hid the fawns
that drew her, but could not hide the
shells and tropic flowers with which
she played&mdash;but could not hide the
lovely smiles by which she uttered
her trust in the mighty cathedral, and
in the cherubim that looked down
upon her from the topmost shafts of
its pillars. Face to face she was meeting
us; face to face she rode, as if
danger there were none. "Oh baby!"
I exclaimed, "shalt thou be the ransom
for Waterloo? Must we, that
carry tidings of great joy to every
people, be messengers of ruin to thee?"
In horror I rose at the thought; but
then also, in horror at the thought,
rose one that was sculptured on the
bas-relief&mdash;a Dying Trumpeter. Solemnly
from the field of battle he rose
to his feet; and, unslinging his stony
trumpet, carried it, in his dying anguish,
to his stony lips&mdash;sounding
once, and yet once again; proclamation
that, in <i>thy</i> ears, oh baby! must
have spoken from the battlements of
death. Immediately deep shadows
fell between us, and aboriginal silence.
The choir had ceased to sing. The
hoofs of our horses, the rattling of our
harness, alarmed the graves no more.
By horror the bas-relief had been unlocked
into life. By horror we, that
were so full of life, we men and our
horses, with their fiery fore-legs rising
in mid air to their everlasting gallop,
were frozen to a bas-relief. Then a
third time the trumpet sounded; the
seals were taken off all pulses; life, and
the frenzy of life, tore into their channels
again; again the choir burst forth
in sunny grandeur, as from the muffling
of storms and darkness; again
the thunderings of our horses carried
temptation into the graves. One cry
burst from our lips as the clouds,
drawing off from the aisle, showed it
empty before us&mdash;"Whither has the
infant fled?&mdash;is the young child caught
up to God?" Lo! afar off, in a vast
recess, rose three mighty windows to
the clouds; and on a level with their
summits, at height insuperable to
man, rose an altar of purest alabaster.
On its eastern face was trembling a
crimson glory. Whence came <i>that</i>?
Was it from the reddening dawn that
now streamed <i>through</i> the windows?
Was it from the crimson robes of the
martyrs that were painted <i>on</i> the windows?
Was it from the bloody bas-reliefs
of earth? Whencesoever it
were&mdash;there, within that crimson radiance,
suddenly appeared a female
head, and then a female figure. It
was the child&mdash;now grown up to woman's
height. Clinging to the horns
of the altar, there she stood&mdash;sinking,
rising, trembling, fainting&mdash;raving,
despairing; and behind the volume of
incense that, night and day, streamed
upwards from the altar, was seen the
fiery font, and dimly was descried
the outline of the dreadful being that
should baptise her with the baptism of
death. But by her side was kneeling
her better angel, that hid his face
with wings; that wept and pleaded
for <i>her</i>; that prayed when <i>she</i> could
<i>not</i>; that fought with heaven by tears
for <i>her</i> deliverance; which also, as he
raised his immortal countenance from
his wings, I saw, by the glory in his
eye, that he had won at last.</p>

<h3>5.</h3>

<p>Then rose the agitation, spreading
through the infinite cathedral, to its
agony; then was completed the passion
of the mighty fugue. The golden
tubes of the organ, which as yet had
but sobbed and muttered at intervals&mdash;gleaming
amongst clouds and surges
of incense&mdash;threw up, as from fountains
unfathomable, columns of heart-shattering
music. Choir and anti-choir
were filling fast with unknown
voices. Thou also, Dying Trumpeter!&mdash;with
thy love that was victorious,
and thy anguish that was finishing,
didst enter the tumult: trumpet and
echo&mdash;farewell love, and farewell
anguish&mdash;rang through the dreadful
<i>sanctus</i>. We, that spread flight before
us, heard the tumult, as of
flight, mustering behind us. In fear
we looked round for the unknown
steps that, in flight or in pursuit, were
gathering upon our own. Who were
these that followed? The faces, which
no man could count&mdash;whence were
<i>they</i>? "Oh, darkness of the grave!"
I exclaimed, "that from the crimson
altar and from the fiery font wert visited
with secret light&mdash;that wert
searched by the effulgence in the angel's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_755">755</span>
eye&mdash;were these indeed thy
children? Pomps of life, that, from
the burials of centuries, rose again to
the voice of perfect joy, could it be <i>ye</i>
that had wrapped me in the reflux of
panic?" What ailed me, that I should
fear when the triumphs of earth were
advancing? Ah! Pariah heart within
me, that couldst never hear the sound
of joy without sullen whispers of
treachery in ambush; that, from six
years old, didst never hear the promise
of perfect love, without seeing
aloft amongst the stars fingers as of
a man's hand writing the secret legend&mdash;"<i>ashes
to ashes, dust to dust!</i>"&mdash;wherefore
shouldst <i>thou</i> not fear,
though all men should rejoice? Lo!
as I looked back for seventy leagues
through the mighty cathedral, and
saw the quick and the dead that sang
together to God, together that sang
to the generations of man&mdash;ah! raving,
as of torrents that opened on every
side: trepidation, as of female and
infant steps that fled&mdash;ah! rushing, as
of wings that chased! But I heard a
voice from heaven, which said&mdash;"Let
there be no reflux of panic&mdash;let there
be no more fear, and no more sudden
death! Cover them with joy as the
tides cover the shore!" <i>That</i> heard
the children of the choir, <i>that</i> heard
the children of the grave. All the
hosts of jubilation made ready to
move. Like armies that ride in pursuit,
they moved with one step. Us,
that, with laurelled heads, were passing
from the cathedral through its
eastern gates, they overtook, and, as
with a garment, they wrapped us
round with thunders that overpowered
our own. As brothers we moved together;
to the skies we rose&mdash;to the
dawn that advanced&mdash;to the stars that
fled: rendering thanks to God in the
highest&mdash;that, having hid his face
through one generation behind thick
clouds of War, once again was ascending&mdash;was
ascending from Waterloo&mdash;in
the visions of Peace:&mdash;rendering
thanks for thee, young girl! whom
having overshadowed with his ineffable
passion of Death&mdash;suddenly did
God relent; suffered thy angel to
turn aside his arm; and even in thee,
sister unknown! shown to me for a
moment only to be hidden for ever,
found an occasion to glorify his
goodness. A thousand times, amongst
the phantoms of sleep, has he shown
thee to me, standing before the golden
dawn, and ready to enter its gates&mdash;with
the dreadful Word going before
thee&mdash;with the armies of the grave
behind thee; shown thee to me, sinking,
rising, fluttering, fainting, but
then suddenly reconciled, adoring: a
thousand times has he followed thee
in the worlds of sleep&mdash;through
storms; through desert seas; through
the darkness of quicksands; through
fugues and the persecution of fugues;
through dreams, and the dreadful resurrections
that are in dreams&mdash;only
that at the last, with one motion of
his victorious arm, he might record
and emblazon the endless resurrections
of his love!

<h2 id="FREE_TRADE_AT_ITS_ZENITH">FREE TRADE AT ITS ZENITH.</h2>

<p>It was observed by Sir Robert
Peel, in his speech on the subject of
Free Trade in the House of Commons,
in the last session of parliament, that
those who reproached the new system
with all the suffering the country had
undergone during the last three years,
forgot or concealed the fact, that that
system was partially introduced by
the tariff of 1842, which so materially
diminished the import-duties on rude
produce in that year; and that the three
following years (those of 1843, 1844,
and 1845) were the most prosperous
that Great Britain has ever experienced.
Is it then just, he added, when
<i>quasi</i> free trade in 1842 produced such
beneficial results, to charge complete
free trade in 1846 with the subsequent
distress which has occurred; the more
especially as adventitious causes&mdash;in
particular, the Irish famine of 1846,
and the European revolutions of 1848&mdash;amply
account for the change, without
supposing that the same principles,
when carried into practice in
1846, produced such widely different
results from those which had attended
their adoption, to a certain extent,
four years before.</p>

<p>The observation is a fair one, and
apparently of material weight in the
great question now at issue in the
nation. When properly considered,
it gives no countenance to the free-trade
measures which the right hon.
baronet has introduced, but only
shows that it is to the combination of
those measures, with another element
of still more general and potent
agency, that the disaster has been
owing. In the interval, be it recollected,
between 1842 and 1846, <i>the
new currency restriction bills were
passed</i>. The Bank Charter Bill of
England received the royal assent
in 1844, that of Scotland and Ireland
in 1845. Free trade in grain was
introduced in July 1846; in sugar, in
May 1847; in shipping, in May 1849.
The harvests of the years from 1846
to 1849 have been, as usual in this
climate, checkered: that of 1846 was
fair in grain, but sadly deficient in
potatoes; that of 1847 was above an
average in both; that of 1848, deficient
in the south of England in corn;
that of 1849, generally very good.
The years from 1842 to 1846, therefore,
were not a trial of free trade and
a restricted currency, <i>acting simultaneously</i>&mdash;they
were a trial only of
<i>semi</i>-free trade, without the new monetary
laws, coexisting with a railway
mania in the palmy days of its
progress, and other favourable circumstances,
which concealed, as will
be immediately shown, its actual tendency.
Real free trade has begun to
act, <i>along with a restricted currency,
for the first time, in 1846</i>. The harvests
since have been, on the whole,
average ones&mdash;neither better nor
worse than generally may, in this
variable climate, be expected in future
years. It is since 1846, therefore,
that we are to look, in this climate,
for the real proof of the effects of the
<i>combined free-trade and currency measures</i>
which Sir Robert Peel has introduced;
and unless they are taken
together, the practical tendency of
both will be entirely misunderstood.
The right hon. baronet has done a
great service to the cause of truth, by
pointing out the difference in the state
of the country before and after 1846;
and we shall endeavour to follow up
the subject by tracing the difference
to its real source, and endeavouring
to detach from the question the simultaneous
circumstances which have
been so often referred to as explaining
the phenomena. The inquiry is the
more important, that the Protection
party as a body have, with a few
striking and illustrious exceptions,
never seen the currency question in
its true light, as accompanied with that
of free trade, and, by not doing so,
have both voluntarily relinquished
the most powerful lever wherewith to
shake the strength of their opponents,
and failed in instructing the public
mind either in the real causes of their
sufferings, or the means by which they
are likely to be, alleviated.</p>

<p>Various circumstances have been
studiously kept out of view by the
free-trade party, in reference to the
years from 1842 to 1846, which really
were mainly instrumental in producing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_757">757</span>
the prosperity of that period. And
many others have been emphatically
dwelt upon, in reference to the years
since 1846, which really had very
little hand in producing these disasters.</p>

<p>The first circumstance which had a
powerful influence in producing the
prosperity from 1842 to 1846, was the
return of fine seasons after five bad
harvests in succession, which closed
in 1841. The summer, and still more
the autumn, of 1842, was a long and
unbroken period of sunshine, which
gladdened the hearts of men after the
long series of dreary and cheerless
years which had preceded it. The
subsequent years, from 1842 to 1846,
were very fine seasons, the harvests
of which were all above an average.
This is decisively proved by a comparison
of the average prices of grain
for the years from 1839 to 1841, and
from 1842 to 1845.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The tariff of
1842 without doubt contributed to
bring about, in some degree, this reduction
of prices; but still, as the
sliding-scale was then in operation,
and the import duties were in general
8s. and 9s. the quarter, the effect
must have been mainly owing to the
succession of fine seasons. No one
can have lived through that period,
without recollecting that this was the
case. But the cheap prices which
result from abundant harvests and
improved cultivation at home, are the
greatest of all public blessings, as
much as the cheap prices arising from
an extended foreign importation and
declining agriculture at home, are the
greatest of all curses. The first enriches
the manufacturer, by the previous
comfort of the farmer, and the
plenty diffused through the land by
his exertions; the last gives a temporary
stimulus to the manufacturer,
by the cheapness which is fatal to the
domestic cultivator, and, by abridging
the home market, speedily makes the
manufacturer share in his ruin.</p>

<p>The second circumstance which
tended to produce the prosperity from
1842 to 1845, was the glorious successes
which, in the first of these
years, succeeded to the Affghanistaun
disasters. We all recollect the throb
of exultation which beat in the breast
of the nation when the astonishing
news arrived, in November 1842,
that a single Delhi Gazette had announced
the second capture of Cabul,
in the centre of Asia, and the dictating
a glorious peace to the Celestial Empire,
under the walls of Nankin. Not
only was our Indian empire secured
for a long period, by those astonishing
triumphs, but its strength was demonstrated
in a way of all others the best
calculated to insure confidence in its
future prosperity. The effect of this
upon our manufacturing and commercial
prosperity was great and immediate.
Confidence revived from so
marvellous a proof of the resources
and spirit of the nation, which had so
speedily risen superior to so terrible a
disaster. Speculation was renewed
on a great scale, from the sanguine
ideas entertained of the boundless
markets opened for our manufactures
in the centre of Asia, and in the
Chinese dominions. Sir Robert Peel
is entitled to great credit for the
glorious turn thus given to our Eastern
affairs, and the gleam of sunshine
which they threw upon the
affairs of the nation; for his fortitude,
when the previous disastrous news
arrived, was mainly instrumental in
producing it. But free-trade principles,
and the tariff of 1842, had no
more to do with it than they had with
the affairs of the moon.</p>

<p>The third circumstance which tended
to bring about the prosperity from
1842 to 1845, was the revival in the
home market, which, on the first
gleam of returning prosperity, arose
with redoubled energy from the
very magnitude of previous deterioration
and suffering. During the
long train of disasters which followed
the great importation of grain,
and consequent exportation of the precious
metals, in 1839&mdash;which compelled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_758">758</span>
the Bank of England, for the first time,
recorded in history, to have recourse
to the Bank of France for assistance&mdash;all
classes of the people had undergone
very severe privations. The
depression had been general in extent,
and unprecedented in duration, till it
was entirely thrown into the shade by
the effects of the terrible monetary
crisis of October 1847. Stocks of
goods were reduced to the lowest
amount consistent with the keeping up
even a show of business; comforts of
various sorts had been long abandoned
by a large portion of the middle and
working classes. At the same time,
capital, in great part unemployed, accumulated
in the hands of moneyed
men, and the competition for safe
investment lowered the rate of interest.
It was soon down to 3
and 2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent. In these circumstances
the revival of trade, owing to
the Eastern victories and fine harvest
of 1842, acted immediately, and with
the most vivifying effect, on the home
market. A rush took place to replace
worn out garments, to revive long
abandoned but unforgotten enjoyments.
This result always ensues,
and is attended with very important
effects, after a long period of depression
and suffering. It is beginning,
though in a slight degree, and from
the same causes, amongst us at this
time. But, no opinion can be formed,
of the extent or probable duration of
such revived activity, from its intensity
on its first appearance.</p>

<p>The last, and, without doubt, the
most important circumstance which
produced the great prosperity from
1842 to 1845, was the monetary
change produced by the Bank Charter
Act of 1844.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Peel admitted, in the
debate on the currency at the opening
of last session of parliament, that the
act of 1844 had failed in one of its
principal objects&mdash;viz., the discouraging
of perilous and irrational
speculation. He might have gone a
step farther, and admitted that it had
been the greatest possible <i>encourager,
for a short season, of the most absurd
and dangerous undertakings</i>. The
proof of this is decisive. The Bank
Charter Act was passed in May 1844,
and from that time till the first check
experienced in October 1845, was,
beyond all comparison, the wildest
and most absurd season of speculation
ever known in English history.
Among others, railways, to the amount
of £363,000,000 sterling, received the
sanction of the legislature, within two
years after the new Bank Charter
Act had passed. And so far was
government from giving any check to
these undertakings&mdash;the results of
which, monstrous when co-existing
with a fettered currency, are apparent
in the present wreck of railway property&mdash;that
they gave them the utmost
encouragement, both by lowering the
sum required for deposits from ten to
five per cent, and by bestowing, at once
in public and private, the most lavish
encomiums on the immense present
and prospective blessings they would
confer upon the country. It is not
surprising that a government, looking
only to temporary objects, did so;
for the railway mania, while it lasted,
and before the ruinous effects in which
it necessarily terminated, when fettered
by the currency laws, had developed
themselves, gave a passing
stimulus to the demand for labour,
and increase to industry, which rendered
men blind to the whole consequences
of the course on which they
were launched. Sir Robert Peel ably
and emphatically enforced the favourable
condition of the nation, and dwelt
with peculiar emphasis on the diminution
in criminal commitments
through the country, in his opening
speech of the session of 1846&mdash;although
he ascribed it to the free-trade measures,
not the first effect of the general
insanity on the subject of railways.</p>

<p>It is now perfectly apparent, and is
generally understood, that the fatal
Bank Charter Act was the main cause
of the ruinous railway mania which
has since spread distress and ruin so
widely through the country. The
reason is evident. It at once emancipated
the Bank directors from every
consideration, except that of making
the most, as ordinary bankers, of their
capital; and subjected them to such
heavy expenses, from the vast quantity
of specie they were obliged to
keep in their vaults, as rendered a
very extensive pushing of their business
in every direction a matter of
necessity. The effect of these concurring
circumstances was soon apparent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_759">759</span>
Interest was lowered, immediately
after the passing of the Bank
Charter Act, to <i>two per cent for first-class
bills</i>, or still lower, as appears
from the subjoined table furnished by
Messrs Gurney and Overend, "the
greatest bill-brokers in the world."<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
The facility of getting discounts increased
beyond all precedent the issues
of the banks. Those of the Bank of
England rose to £21,000,000; and of
all country bankers in a similar proportion.
The total notes in circulation,
in England alone, reached
£28,000,900; in Great Britain and Ireland
they exceeded £39,000,000. It
was this copious issue of notes which
gave, for the time at least, nearly
sufficient accommodation for the immense
undertakings which were set
on foot; which, beyond all doubt, both
gave birth to, and nurtured the infancy
of that vast network of railways
which so soon overspread the country,
and, while it was in course of formation,
diffused such general prosperity
over the land.</p>

<p>Had the impulse thus given to industry,
and the enormous domestic
undertakings thus set on foot by the
sanction and with the approbation of
government, been cautiously sustained,
as a similar impulse had been during the
war, by a corresponding increase of
the circulation, based on a footing
which was <i>not liable to be contracted
by a failure of the harvest, or an
enhanced demand for gold in foreign
states</i>, it might have been the commencement
of an era of prosperity,
and a general spread of happiness,
unprecedented in British annals. It
had one immense advantage, which
distinguished it both from the previous
lavish expenditure during the war,
and the extravagant South American
speculations which ended in the monetary
catastrophe of December 1825.
The money was all expended at
home, and on undertakings useful
to the nation. No man will dispute,
that, whether or not all the
railways undertaken during that period
were in themselves reasonable,
or likely to yield a dividend to
the shareholders, they were beyond
all doubt, one and all of them, advantageous
to the public. They afforded
facilities for the transit of goods and
the conveyance of passengers, which
were not only an immense advantage
to individuals, but a great relief and
benefit to the commerce and manufactures
of the country. So far from
being blamed, government deserve the
very highest credit for having given
this direction to the industry and
expenditure of the nation. Their
fault consisted in the simultaneous
and fatal measures they adopted regarding
the currency.</p>

<p>Having taken this great step in
the right direction, it became the first
and most important duty of government
to have provided, simultaneously
with the commencement of the undertaking,
<i>a currency independent of
foreign drains</i>, commensurate to the
vast addition made to the industry
and engagements of the nation. Its
<i>capital</i> was far more than adequate to
the undertakings, how vast soever.
This is now decisively proved by the
event. Two-thirds of the railways are
finished; the remaining third is in
course of construction; and interest is
in London from <i>three</i> to <i>two-and-a-half
per cent.</i> But capital alone is not sufficient
for carrying on undertakings.
Currency also is requisite; and if that
be deficient, the most boundless overflow
of capital will not avert a
monetary crash, or save the nation
from the most dreadful calamities.
Here, too, the event has thrown a
broad and decisive light on this vital
question, and the cause of our calamities.
Interest was fixed by government,
after the crash, for advances by
the Bank of England, in October 1847,
at eight per cent; it rose, in private
transactions, to twelve and fifteen per
cent. Why was that? Not because
capital was awanting, but because the
bankers, from the drain of specie to
buy foreign grain, and the operation
of the Bank Charter Acts of 1844 and
1845, could not venture to issue notes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_760">760</span>
to their customers. The nation resembled
a great army, in which vast stores
of provisions existed in the magazines
at its disposal, but a series of absurd
regulations affecting the commissariat
prevented the grain they contained
being issued to the soldiers. Accordingly,
when the absurd restrictions
were removed, things soon began to
amend. When the Bank Charter
Act was <i>pro tempore</i> repealed, by Lord
John Russell's famous letter of October
1847, the effect was instantaneous
in allaying the panic, and interest
gradually fell, until now money has
become overflowing, and it is to be
had at two per cent, although the
years since that time have been the
most disastrous to capital ever known
in the British annals, so that no subsequent
increase has been possible.</p>

<p>What government should have done,
when they engaged the nation in the
vast system of inland railways, was
what Pitt actually did, with such
happy effect, when its currency was
exposed to a similar strain from
foreign expenditure, and immense engagements,
in 1797. They should
have provided a currency under proper
control as to amount, but capable
of being increased, according to the
wants and engagements of society,
and, above all, not liable to be withdrawn
by the mutations of commerce,
or the demand for gold in
foreign states. The example of Great
Britain during the war, when a gigantic
expenditure, varying from eighty
to one hundred and twenty millions
yearly, was carried on for twenty
years with the aid of such an expansive
<i>domestic currency</i>&mdash;not only without
any lasting distress, save from the
stoppage of foreign markets, but with
the <i>utmost prosperity and happiness to
all classes</i>, although guineas had altogether
disappeared from the circulation&mdash;was
not only an example of
what was required, but the best indication
of <i>how</i> it was to be done. No
period more loudly called for such a
precautionary measure than one in
which, under the sanction of government,
no less than £363,000,000 was
to be expended on railways in the
short space of four years&mdash;a sum
equal, if the change in the value of
money is taken into consideration, to
£500,000,000 during the war&mdash;at a
time when all other branches of industry,
foreign and domestic, were in
an unusual state of activity, from the
sudden return of prosperity after a
long period of suffering. To expect
that the nation, without some addition
to its currency, could carry out
so great an increase in its undertakings,
was as hopeless as to imagine
that an army, with a half added to its
mouths, is to go on successfully with
no addition made to its distribution of
rations. And it is evident that this
addition to the currency could be
effectually made only by extending
the paper circulation on a scale proportioned
to the increase of work
undertaken. By no possible means
could gold, in adequate quantities,
be brought to the scene of activity,
the place where it was required; and
even if brought there, no reliance
could be placed on its continuing there
for any length of time. On the contrary,
nothing is more certain than
that it would speedily be re-exported
to other countries where it was less
plentiful, and, therefore, more valuable;
and thus its support would have
been lost at the very time when it was
most required.</p>

<p>The rise of prices during the war,
when such a domestic currency was
provided by government in adequate
quantities, was really owing, not so
much to the circulation having become
redundant, as to its having permitted
an adequate remuneration to
be given to industry. This is a most
important consideration, which Mr
Taylor has most ably illustrated.
The proof that the circulation had not,
like the assignats of France, become
redundant, is to be found in two
things which are decisive of the point:
1. At no period of the war was there
any difference between the price of an
article when paid in bank notes and
when paid in silver. No man ever
saw the price of anything five pounds
in bank notes, and four pounds ten
shillings in silver. <i>Gold</i> bore an enhanced
price, because it was required
urgently for the operations of the Continental
armies. 2. The increase in
the paper circulation, considerable as
it was, was yet not so great as the
parallel and simultaneous increase in
our national industry, as measured
by our exports, imports, and public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_761">761</span>
expenditure.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Prices rose, therefore,
and reached, for a time, more than
double their level anterior to the contest,
not because too much paper had
been put in circulation, but because
enough had been issued to let the demand
for labour keep pace with the
enlarged undertakings of the nation.</p>

<p>Instead of imitating this great and
decisive example of wise and statesmanlike
policy, what did Sir Robert
Peel and the Free-traders do, on the
commencement of a similar period of
vastly augmented national industry?
Why, they did just the reverse. Not
only did they make no provision for
enlarging the currency of the nation
at the time, when they themselves
had occasioned or sanctioned so immense
an increase to its undertakings,
but they took the most effectual measures
possible to <i>contract</i> the circulation,
both in gold and paper, directly
in proportion to the necessity for its
expansion. They first passed a law
which limited the circulation of the
Bank of England, irrespective of the
notes issued on the basis of gold in their
coffers, to £14,000,000; and that of the
whole banks in Great Britain and Ireland
to about £32,000,000; and then
they introduced a system of free trade
which permitted the unlimited entrance
of foreign agricultural produce at a nominal
duty, and thereby sent nearly
half the gold headlong out of the
country. Under the influence of this
monstrous system, the gold in the
vaults of the Bank of England was progressively
diminished, until, in the end
of October 1847, it was reduced to
£564,000 sterling in the banking department;
at the very time that, by the
same judicious law, above £8,000,000
of sovereigns were lying useless, and
locked up in the issue department of the
same establishment. The governor of
the bank very candidly admitted, in
his examination before the House of
Lords, that the bank, under the existing
system, might have broke while
there were still £8,000,000 of sovereigns
lost to them and the nation in
the cellars of the issue department.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
Of course the whole banks of the
country were compelled instantly to
contract their credits, and force payment
of their debts, and thence the
universal distress and ruin which
ensued. And all this took place at the
very time that the bank had eight
millions of sovereigns chained up by
act of parliament in its cellars, at
the issue end of the building; and
when the government, which so
chained it up, had landed the nation,
by act of parliament, in engagements
requiring an expenditure on railway
shares of £363,000,000 in the next
four years. You may search the
annals of the world in vain for a similar
instance of infatuation in the
rulers of a nation, and self-immolation
in a people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_762">762</span></p>

<p>It will be said that the vast importation
of grain, in the course of 1847,
was a matter of necessity, from the
failure of the potato crops in Ireland
in the preceding autumn; and that,
be the consequences what they may,
they cannot be ascribed to Sir Robert
Peel or the Free-traders. In one sense
this is undoubtedly true. It is certain
that the most staunch Protectionists
would never have objected to the
largest importation of grain, and exportation
of sovereigns, in a period
such as that of severe and unlooked-for
scarcity. It was the precise object
of the sliding-scale to admit grain, in
periods of scarcity, free of all duty.
But what the Free-traders and Sir Robert
Peel are chargeable with, is having
established a system of currency so
fettered and restricted by absurd regulations,
that the exportation of sovereigns
<i>led necessarily and inevitably to
a contraction of paper accommodation,
and a shock to credit over the whole
country</i>; and aggravated the danger by
a monstrous regulation, which exposed
the bank to the risk of stopping payment
when they had still eight millions
in gold&mdash;enough to have enabled
them, perhaps, to go on&mdash;at one end of
their establishment. They are responsible
for the dreadful error of having
not only done nothing to extend and secure
the currency from being exported
or contracted, when they had added so
enormously to the internal engagements
of the kingdom, but done everything,
by the establishment of a permanent
system of free trade, and a permanently
fettered currency, to secure
its reappearance on occasion of every
future recurrence of an indifferent
harvest, or any continuance of a great
importation.</p>

<p>It is the consciousness of this terrible
calamity, impending over the nation,
which terrifies all the directors of
banks, and paralyses industry in so
grievous a manner over the whole
country. If you ask any moneyed
man, what is the cause of the insecurity
so universally complained of in
money transactions over the country,
and the reluctance of bankers to advance
largely, even when their coffers
are overflowing, to persons of the best
credit? they will invariably answer,
that they are afraid of a commercial
crisis; that they do not know when it
may come on: and that they must be,
at all times, prepared for a storm. It is
this indefinite dread, the natural result
of the catastrophe of 1847, which
renders them so cautious, and keeps
the nation starved of accommodation,
at the very time that Lombard Street
is overflowing with money seeking for
investment. It is no wonder they are
afraid. The sword of Damocles is suspended
over their heads, and thence
their terror. They know that the heavy
rains, and consequent importation of
grain, in 1839 into the British islands,
forced the Bank of England to apply
for aid to the Bank of France, caused
the United States Bank of America to
stop payment, and rendered three-fourths
of the traders in the United
States bankrupt. The recollection of
the dreadful crisis of 1847, brought on
by the great importation of grain and
exportation of sovereigns in that year,
is fresh in their minds. They see the
importations of food going on without
intermission, in the face of exceedingly
low prices, at the rate of <i>fifteen
millions of quarters</i> a-year, being
nearly quadruple that of 1839, which
was four million quarters.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> They
know that the grain countries will take
our gold to any amount, but not our
manufactures, because they do not
want them, or are too poor to buy
them; and they ask, How is all this
grain to be paid? In what is all this
to end? How are the bills, drawn to
pay for these exports, to be met? So
general is this feeling of dread, from
the effects of a drain on our metallic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_763">763</span>
resources to pay for the vast importations
of grain going forward, that when
the author, in the beginning of last
autumn, said to the chief officer of one
of the first banking establishments in
Britain, that "three weeks' rain in
August would render half the merchants
in England bankrupt," he replied&mdash;"Sir,
three weeks' rain in
August will make half the merchants
in Europe bankrupt."</p>

<p>That it is this fatal dependence
of the currency, and consequent credit
of the country, on the retention of its
gold circulation, under circumstances
when, from the vast importation of
grain going forward, <i>it is impossible to
retain it</i>, which is the real cause of the
calamitous state of the country for the
last three years, and not either the
potato rot or the European revolutions,
to which the Free-traders ascribe it, is
evident from the slightest consideration.
The potato rot of 1846, which
has been the sheet-anchor of the Free-traders
ever since&mdash;the scapegoat
which they hoped would answer for
all their sins&mdash;was never, by the most
determined of their party, set down
as having occasioned a loss of
above £15,000,000 sterling. Call it
£20,000,000 to avoid cavil. The
strength of the case will admit of any
concession. Now, the value of the
agricultural produce of the United
Kingdom, prior to the free trade in
grain, was generally estimated at
£300,000,000.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> A deficiency of
£20,000,000, or a <i>fifteenth part</i>,
might occasion, doubtless, the most
acute <i>local</i> distress in the districts in
which it was most severely felt; but it
could never, <i>irrespective of its action on
the currency</i>, occasion a general monetary
and commercial crisis. England
and Scotland exported little or nothing
to the boys of Munster and Connaught,
where the failure occurred. There is no
more reason, had it not been for the currency
laws, why a failure of the potato
crop in Ireland should have produced
a monetary crisis in Great Britain,
than a failure in the potato crop of
Norway.</p>

<p>Again, the revolutions in Europe in
1848, of which so much has been said
to account for the distress, are equally
inadequate to explain the phenomenon.
They could, of course, affect
the European market for our export
goods only; and they, taken altogether,
only amount, to the countries affected
by the revolutions, to £13,000,000&mdash;little
more than a fourth part of our exports,
which vary from £51,000,000
to £60,000,000. Supposing a half of
this export, or £7,000,000, had been
lost, during the year 1848, by the
French, German, and Italian revolutions;
what is that amidst the mass,
thirty-fold greater, of our total manufactures,
which some years ago were
estimated at £133,000,000 for the
home market, and £50,000,000 for
the foreign. They are now unquestionably
above £200,000,000 annually.
But let it be supposed that the <i>whole</i>
defalcation of our exports, from
£60,000,000 in 1845, to £53,000,000
in 1848, was owing to the European
revolutions, and none at all to the
paralysis of domestic industry by the
effects of free trade and a fettered
currency&mdash;seven millions deficit, out
of £200,000,000 annual produce of
manufactures, is only a <i>twenty-ninth</i>
part. Is it possible that so trifling a
deficit can have been the cause of the
terrible calamity which overtook the
country in 1848 and 1849, the more
especially as the harvest of 1847 was
so good, that, by orders of government,
a public thanksgiving was returned
for it? That calamity was
unparalleled in point of extent, and
has, in two years, swept away at least
one half of the whole commercial and
manufacturing wealth of the kingdom.
The thing is perfectly ridiculous. The
failure of an eighth part of our annual
export, and a twenty-ninth part of
our annual creation of manufactures,
might occasion considerable distress
in the particular places or branches of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_764">764</span>
manufacture principally affected, but
it could never explain the universal
paralysis, affecting the home trade
even more than the foreign, which
followed the monetary crisis of October
1847.</p>

<p>Again, as to the European revolutions
of 1848, although, undoubtedly,
they largely contributed to interrupt
the commerce of this country with
central Europe, and may fairly be
considered as the principal cause of
the decline in the exports of that year,
yet it may be doubted whether the
influx of wealth, from the distracted
monarchies of Europe, which they occasioned,
did not more than counterbalance
that disadvantage. England,
during the convulsions of France,
Germany, and Italy, became the bank
of Europe. Wealth flowed in from all
quarters, for investment in the only
capital left which held out the prospect
of security. The solid specie
which then was brought to London
for purchase into the British funds, in
the course of 1848, has been estimated,
by competent authorities, at
£9,000,000 sterling. Beyond all
doubt, this great influx of the precious
metals from continental Europe&mdash;at a
time when it was so much required, in
consequence of the enormous exportation
of specie which free trade was
inducing, and the monstrous monetary
laws which contracted the paper circulation
in proportion as it was withdrawn&mdash;had
a powerful effect in counteracting
the evils we had brought
upon ourselves, and sustaining the
currency and national credit, which
the Free-traders had done so much to
destroy. And as this was an alleviation
of the evil at its fountain-head,
it is next to certain that the European
revolutions of 1848, so far from having
occasioned the distress in Great
Britain in that year, had a material
effect in abating it.</p>

<p>It is vain, therefore, for the Free-traders
to push forward extraneous
and separate events, as the cause of
the dreadful calamities which have
overtaken the country since October
1847; calamities which all the witnesses
examined in both Houses of
Parliament, in the committees on
commercial distress, described as <i>altogether
unparalleled</i>. They arose, evidently,
not from the failure of crops in
a particular place, or the temporary
stoppage in the foreign vent for a particular
branch of manufacture&mdash;causes
which only touched the extremities&mdash;but
from some great cause affecting
the heart of the empire, and which
through it paralysed all its members.
And when it is recollected that, after
having landed the nation in extra domestic
engagements, for the next four
years, to the amount of £360,000,000,
the government adopted the most
decisive and effective measures to
contract the currency, and, after making
it mainly dependant on the retention
of gold in the country, they took
steps which sent that gold headlong
abroad&mdash;in exchange for enormously
increased importations, the fruit of
free trade&mdash;it is not difficult to discover
what that cause was.</p>

<p>But all these evils, it is said, are
over. We have passed through the
desert, and arrived at the promised
land. Free trade, disjoined from the
extraneous circumstances which have
hitherto concealed its real effect, is at
length beginning to appear in its true
colours. The Continent is pacified;
the trade to France and Germany has
revived; the revenue is improving;
the exports in September were
£2,000,000 more than in the corresponding
month of last year: wait a
little and we shall soon be in Elysium,
and free trade and a fettered currency
will realise all their promised advantages.
We are not unaware of the <i>Io
Pæans</i> which are already sung from
the Liberal camp on this subject, and
it is precisely for that reason that,
when FREE TRADE IS AT ITS ZENITH,
we have taken the opportunity
to examine its effects. We
have seen that the prosperity from
1842 to 1845 arose from extraneous
causes, with which the tariff of the
first of these years had nothing to do;
and that the disasters from 1847 to
1849 were not in any sensible degree
owing to external or separate calamities,
but were the direct and inevitable
effect of the establishment of
a system of free trade, at the very
time when the industry of the nation
was manacled by the restriction of
absurd and destructive monetary
laws. Let us now examine our present
condition, and see whether or
not we are in an enviable position at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_765">765</span>
home or abroad; whether the industry
of the country can possibly survive,
or its revenue be maintained, under
the present system; and whether the
seeds of another catastrophe, as terrible
as that of 1847, are not already
spread in the land.</p>

<p>In one particular the Free-traders
are unquestionably right. Beyond
all doubt, the external circumstances
of the nation, at present, are in the
highest degree favourable to its manufacturing
and trading interests. We
are at peace with all the world, and,
thank God, there is no immediate
appearance of its being broken. The
markets of continental Europe have,
for six months past, been entirely laid
open to our merchants, by the settlement
of France under the <i>quasi</i>
empire of Louis Napoleon, and the
extinction of the war in Italy and
Germany. Rome is taken; Hungary
is subdued; Baden is pacified; the
war in Schleswig is at an end; the
Danish blockade is raised; California
has given an extraordinary impulse
to activity and enterprise in the
West; the victory of Goojerat has
extinguished, it is to be hoped for a
long period, all appearance of disturbance
in the East. The harvest,
just reaped, has been uncommonly
fine in grain, both in Great Britain
and Ireland: that of the potatoes
above an average in the latter island.
The Chartists of England and Scotland,
astounded at the failure of all
their predictions and the defeat of all
their hopes, are silent; the revolutionists
of Ireland, in utter despair,
are leaving the Emerald Isle. Amidst
the general pacification and cessation
of alarms, old wants and necessities
begin to be felt. Men have discovered
that revolting will not mend
their clothes or fill their bellies. New
garments are required, from the old
being worn out; the women are clamorous
for bonnets and gowns; the
men are sighing for coats and waistcoats.
Provisions are cheap to a degree
unexampled for fourteen years;
wheat is at 41s. the quarter, meat
at 5d. a pound. Capital in London
can be borrowed at 2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent, in
the provinces at 3-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>. That great Liberal
panacea for all evils, a <i>huge importation</i>
of foreign produce, is in full operation.
This year it will probably
reach in value at least £100,000,000
sterling. Let us then, in these eminently
favourable circumstances, examine
the effects of the free-trade
system.</p>

<p>First, with regard to the revenue,
that never-failing index of the national
fortunes. The revenue for the year ending
Oct. 10, 1849, being the last quarter
that has been made up, was only
£236,000 more than that for the year
ending Oct. 10, 1848. That is to say,
during a year when free trade was acting
under the most favourable possible
circumstances, and when the pacification
of the world was reopening markets
long closed to our manufactures,
the revenue only rose a mere trifle
above what it had been in the year
wasted by the triple curse of a monetary
crisis, European revolutions,
Chartist disturbances and Irish rebellion.
Why is this? Evidently because
the effect of free trade and a
restricted currency acting together,
and the dread of a fresh monetary
crisis hanging over our heads from the
unprecedented magnitude of our importations
in every branch of commerce,
have depressed industry at
home to such a degree, that even the
reopening of all the closed markets of
the world, and the rush to fill up the
void, created during fifteen months of
stoppage of intercourse, has been able
to produce no sensible addition to the
public revenue.</p>

<p>Next, as to the exports. The reopening
of the Continental markets,
the pacification of India by the victory
of Goojerat, and the impulse
given to American speculation by the
gold of California, has occasioned a
considerable increase in our exports,
on which the Free-traders are pluming
themselves in an extraordinary degree.
We should be glad to know
in what way free trade pacified India,
extinguished revolution in Europe,
and vivified America by the Californian
diggings. And yet, had these
distant and adventitious occurrences
not taken place, would we have had
to congratulate the manufacturers on
a rise of two millions in September,
and a rise of seven or eight millions on
the whole year? And what, after all,
is a rise of our exports from
£53,000,000 to £60,000,000 or even
£63,000,000 in a year, to the total
manufacturing industry of the country,
which produces at least £200,000,000
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">766</span>
annually? It is scarcely the addition
of a <i>thirtieth</i> part to the annual manufactured
production. The Free-traders
are hard pushed, indeed, when they
are constrained to exult in an addition
to the national industry so trifling,
and wholly brought about by fortunate
external events entirely foreign
to their policy.</p>

<p>In the immense and increasing
amount of our <span class="smcap">Imports</span>, however, the
Free-traders may indeed see, as in a
mirror, the real and inevitable result
of their measures. Their amount for
this year is of course not yet known;
although, from the returns already
procured, it is certain that they
will greatly exceed the level of
last year, which reached £94,000,000.
In all probability they will considerably
exceed £100,000,000. Indeed,
in the single article of grain,
the excess of 1849 over 1848, since
the one shilling duty began in February,
has been so great as much to
exceed in value the augmentation
which has taken place in our exports.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
The importation of grain in the first
eight months of 1849 has been more
than double what it was in the corresponding
period of 1848, and that
in the face of a fine harvest, and
prices throughout the whole period
varying from forty-five to forty-one
shillings a quarter of wheat. The
importation at these low prices has
settled down to a regular average
of about 1,200,000 quarters of all
sorts of grain a-month, or between
fourteen and fifteen millions of all
sorts of grain in a year. This is
just a <i>fourth of the annual subsistence</i>,
estimated in all sorts of grain at
60,000,000 of quarters. This immense
proportion free trade has
already caused to be derived from
foreign supplies, though it has only
been three years in operation, and the
nominal duties only came into operation
in February last.</p>

<p>So vast an increase of importation
is perhaps unprecedented in so short
a period; for, before the change
was made, the importation was so
trifling that, on an average of five
years ending in 1835, it had sunk
to 398,000 quarters. Indeed, the
importation before the five bad harvests,
from 1846 to 1840, had been so
trifling, that it had become nominal
merely, and the nation had gained the
inestimable advantage of being self-supporting.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
With truth did that
decided free-trader, Mr Porter, say,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_767">767</span>
in the last edition of his valuable
work, entitled the <i>Progress of the
Nation</i>&mdash;"The foregoing calculations
show in how small a degree this
country has hitherto been dependent
upon foreigners, in ordinary seasons,
for a due supply of our staple article of
food. These calculations are brought
forward to show how exceedingly
great the increase of agricultural production
must have been, to have thus
effectively kept in a state of independence
a population which has advanced
with so great a degree of rapidity.
To show the fact, the one article of
wheat has been selected, because it is
that which is the most generally consumed
in England; but the position
advanced would be found to hold good,
were we to go through the whole list
of the consumable products of the
earth. The supply of meat, during
the whole years comprised in this
inquiry, has certainly kept pace with
the growth of the population; and, as
regards this portion of human food,
our home agriculturists have, during
almost the whole period, enjoyed a
strict monopoly."<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Things, however, are now changed.
Protection to domestic industry, at
least in agriculture, is at an end;
prices are down to forty shillings the
quarter for wheat, and half that sum
for oats and barley; the prices of
sheep and cattle have fallen enormously
to the home-grower, though
that of meat is far from having declined
in the same proportion; and,
as all this has taken place during a
season of prices low beyond example,
it is evident that it may be expected
to be still greater when we again
experience the usual vicissitudes of
bad harvests in our variable climate.
The returns prove that ever since the
duties on foreign grain became nominal,
in the beginning of February
last, the importation of corn and
flour into Great Britain and Ireland
has gone on steadily at the
rate of 1,200,000 quarters a-month;
and that now seven-eighths of the
supply of the metropolis, and of
all our other great towns, comes
from foreign parts.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> How British
agriculture is to go on staggering
under such a frightful load of foreign
importation into its best markets,
it is not difficult to foresee. Every
scholar knows how Italian agriculture
decayed, under a similar importation
of grain from the distant provinces
of the Roman empire; and
how directly the fall of the empire
was owing to that fatal change.</p>

<p>Putting aside all minor considerations,
which crowd upon the mind in
considering the probable effects of
this prodigious change, there are three
of paramount importance which force
themselves on the attention, any one
of which holds the fate of the empire
suspended in a doubtful balance.</p>

<p>The first is, How is the revenue of
£55,000,000, and the interest of mortgages
at least half as much more,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
to be provided for under so great a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_768">768</span>
reduction in the value of the staple
articles of British agricultural produce?
It has been seen that the total
value of the agricultural produce of
the empire was, anterior to the late
changes, about £300,000,000. If
prices fall on an average a fourth, in
consequence of foreign importations,
which is a most moderate supposition,
probably much within the truth, this
£300,000,000 will be reduced at once
to £225,000,000. But the disastrous
effect of such a reduction is not to be
measured by its absolute amount, considerable
as that amount undoubtedly
is. Its dreadful effect lies here, that
the £75,000,000 thus cut off, absorb
nearly the whole profits of cultivation,
out of which both the rent is paid to
the landlord, and the farmer obtains
the means of livelihood. The remainder
is the cost of production, and
it is not lowered in any sensible
degree. <i>Thus the whole loss falls on
the cultivators.</i> This is just what has
happened under a similar course of
policy in the West Indies, where the
indolent habits of the emancipated
slaves, and free trade in sugar, acting
together, have destroyed the profits
of agriculture; and of course the
islands are rapidly returning to the
jungle and the forest.</p>

<p>Now, if a deficiency at all approaching
to this occurs in the revenue derived
from land&mdash;the sources of <i>three-fifths</i>
of the income of the United
Kingdom&mdash;how, in the name of common
sense, is the revenue to be paid?
How are the jointures of the widows,
the interest of mortgages, and the
other charges on the land, to be made
good, when the change of prices has
absorbed nearly the whole profit of
cultivation? If they are recovered,
what is to remain to the landlord?
How are the home manufacturers, and
the numerous class of shopkeepers in
towns, and, above all, in the metropolis,
who are supported by their expenditure,
to be maintained? It is very
easy to say the fall of rents is a landlord's
question, and the mass of the
people have no interest in it. Who
support the manufacturers and shopkeepers
over the country? The landlords
and holders of securities over the
land furnish at the very least a half
of that support. Of the £5,400,000
a-year, which the Income Tax produces,
£3,200,000, or more than a
half, comes from the land. How
wide-spread, then, will be the distress
produced over the community, and,
above all, to the shopkeepers in towns,
from a change which threatens to dry
up the principal sources from which
their sales are paid.</p>

<p>In the next place, How is the <i>national
independence</i> to be maintained
when we come to import so large a
proportion as from a fourth to a third
of our subsistence from foreign states?
If the chances of war, or a Continental
blockade, interrupt our usual sources of
supply, what is to come of the people?
Who is to guarantee us against famine
prices on any deficiency of our
usual supply from abroad, and our
people from becoming, as the Romans
were in former days, the sport
of the winds and the waves? Observe,
nearly all our foreign supply comes
from two countries only, Russia, or
Prussia, whom it influences, and America.
If we lose our maritime superiority&mdash;and
who will secure its continuance,
now that the Navigation Laws
are repealed?&mdash;we may be at once
blockaded in our harbours, and reduced
in three months to the alternative
of starvation or submission. But
supposing we are not at once reduced to
so humiliating an alternative, is it not
clear that, when we have come practically
to depend for the food of a <i>third</i>
of our people on <i>two</i> foreign states, we
are entirely at the mercy of those two
countries, and can never venture to
assert, even in form, our independence
against them? Without fitting out a
ship of the line, or equipping a
battalion, they can, by the mere
threat of closing their harbours, at
any time starve us into submission.
And what are the nations beneath
whose feet proud Albion is thus content
to place her neck? Russia and
America, the two most rising countries
in existence, and both of which
are actuated by the strongest and the
most undying jealousy of the ancient
glory and maritime preponderance
of this country.</p>

<p>Mr Gurney, "the greatest bill-broker
in the world," has emphatically
declared in public, on more than
one occasion, that the country cannot
go on with its present expenditure;
that £15,000,000 a-year, on the charges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_769">769</span>
of the army and navy, is more than
can possibly be afforded; and that, if
a great reduction is not made, we shall
become bankrupt. His remedy for
this is to disband our troops, sell our
ships of the line, and establish the
reign of peace and bill-broking throughout
the world. On the other hand,
"the greatest captain in the world," the
Duke of Wellington, has made the following
remonstrance to several successive
administrations, on the total
inadequacy of our present establishments,
by sea and land, to secure the
national independence in the political
changes which may be anticipated in
the lapse of time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have in vain endeavoured to awaken
the attention of different administrations
to this state of things, as well known to
our neighbours (rivals in power, at least
former adversaries and enemies) as it is
to ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I suppose that one-half of the whole
regular force of the country would be
stationed in Ireland, which half would
give the garrison for Cork. The remainder
must be supplied from the half of the
whole force at home, stationed in Great
Britain.</p>

<p>The whole force employed at home
in Great Britain and Ireland would not
afford a sufficient number of men for the
mere defence and occupation, on the
breaking out of a war, of the works constructed
for the defence of the dockyards
and naval arsenals, <i>without leaving a
single man disposable</i>.</p>

<p>The measure upon which I have
<i>earnestly entreated different administrations
to decide</i>, which is constitutional, and
has been invariably adopted in time of
peace for the last years, is to raise,
embody, organise, and discipline the militia
of the same number for each of
the three kingdoms united, as during
the late war. This would give an organised
force amounting to about a hundred
and fifty thousand men, which we
might immediately set to work to discipline.
This amount would enable us to establish
the strength of our army. This, with
an augmentation of the force of the regular
army, which would cost £400,000,
would put the country on its legs in respect
to personal force, and I would engage
for its defence, old as I am.</p>

<p>But as we stand now, and if it be
true that the exertions of the fleet alone
are not sufficient to provide for our defence,
<i>we are not safe for a week after the
declaration of war</i>."...</p>

<p>"I shall be deemed foolhardy in engaging
for the defence of the empire with an
army composed of such a force as militia.
I may be so. I confess it, I should infinitely
prefer, and should feel more confidence
in, an army of regular troops.
But I <i>know</i> that I shall not have these.
I can have the others; and if an addition
is made to the existing regular army allotted
for home defence of a force which
would cost £400,000 a-year, there would
be a sufficient disciplined force in the field
to enable him who should command it to
defend the country.</p>

<p>This is my view of our danger and
of our resources. I am aware that our
magazines and arsenals were very inadequately
supplied with ordnance and carriages,
as well as stores of all denominations,
and ammunition.</p>

<p>The deficiency has been occasioned in
part by the sale of arms, and of various
descriptions of ordnance stores, since the
termination of the late war, in order to
diminish the demand of supply to carry
on the peace service of the ordnance, in
part by the conflagration of the arsenal
which occurred in the Tower some years
ago, and by the difficulty under which all
governments in this country <i>labour in
prevailing upon parliament, in time of
peace, to take into consideration measures
necessary for the safety of the country in
time of war</i>."</p>

<p>"I am bordering upon 77 years of age
passed in honour. I hope that the Almighty
may protect me from being again
witness of the tragedy which I cannot
persuade my contemporaries to take
measures to avert."</p></blockquote>

<p>These are strong words, as all those
of the Duke of Wellington, and all
other men of powerful and clear intellect,
are, when they are roused and
thoroughly in earnest. But when
charged with such a subject, the
means of defence and independence to
his country, would a man of his patriotic
feeling use expressions less
strong, when he saw both endangered
by the weakness of successive administrations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_770">770</span>
acting in obedience to the
dictates of a blind and infatuated
people? But if our independence has
been thus menaced by the inadequacy
of our defensive armaments by sea and
land in time past, what is it likely to
be in days to come, when the public
revenue, and the resources of the kingdom,
are prostrated by the combined
action of a currency fettered by the
acts of 1844 and 1845, and national
industry overwhelmed with foreign
competition under the free-trade system
of 1846?</p>

<p>In truth, the peace congresses which
now amuse the world, and give an
opportunity for clever but chimerical
and ignorant men to declaim upon
the speedy advent of a political millennium,
are nothing more than an
effort, on the part of the free-trade
party, to escape from the consequences
of their own measures. Mr Cobden
and the Free-traders of England now
see as clearly as any body, that
cheap prices and a large revenue,
either to individuals or nations, cannot
by possibility co-exist; that the
£100,000,000, promised us from the
abolition of the corn laws, have vanished
into thin air, and that the reduction
of the income of the whole classes
of society under its operation will be
so considerable, that it is quite impossible
the national expenditure can
be maintained. As the touching of
the dividends is not for a moment to
be thought of&mdash;as that would be bringing
the tempest back with a vengeance
on the moneyed class who evoked
it&mdash;his only resource, to make our
expenditure square with our reduced
income, is in disbanding the soldiers,
instituting a national guard, and selling
our stores and ships of war. He
is quite serious in that; and, like all
other fanatics, he is not in the slightest
degree influenced by the decisive
refutation of his principles, which the
universal breaking out of hostilities,
and arming of the world, in consequence
of the French Revolution of
1848, and the momentary triumph of
liberal principles, has afforded. He
is perfectly aware, that if industry
was protected, and we had a currency
equal to the wants and necessities of
the nation, we might, with our extended
population, raise £100,000,000
a-year, with more ease than we now
do fifty millions, and thus secure the
independence of the country, and bid
defiance to all our enemies. But that
would lower the value of money in
the hands of the great capitalists, and
would amount to an admission that
he had been wrong; and, rather than
risk that, he is content to prostrate
the national defences, and hand us
over, unarmed, to the tender mercies of
the Chartists and Repealers at home,
and the Red Republicans or Cossacks
abroad.</p>

<p>The more intelligent of the Liberal
party are now intent on a different
object, but one equally descriptive of
their secret sense of the failure of their
grand panacea of free trade. They
are full of the incalculable effects of
the application of science to agriculture;
expatiate largely on the analysis
of soils and liquid manures, and
indulge in learned disquisitions on
the application of the refuse of towns
and common-sewers to the improvement
and fertilisation of the soil.
From the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, which
treats its readers to a learned <i>exposé</i>
of Liebig's principles, to Sir R. Peel's
protegé, the Dean of Westminster,
who boasts of having tripled the produce
of his land by liquid manure,
this is the grand remedy for the evils
which they now see they have introduced.
It is singular, if there is any
truth in these discoveries, that though
man has been labouring at the soil for
four thousand years, and during that
time had an ample supply of these
fertilising streams, they have never
been brought to light till free trade
made them a question of life and
death to a powerful party in the state.
Having had ample experience of the
application of these liquid manures on
the largest and most favourable scale,
we are able to give a decided opinion
on this subject. Liquid manures are
of great service in enriching <i>meadow</i>
lands, or forcing up <i>coarse but luxuriant
crops of vegetables, such as cabbage
or cauliflower</i>, of which the leaves or
stems, not the seeds or roots, form an
article of food. But they do not <i>permanently</i>
enrich the soil: their effect
is over in a few weeks. A fresh inundation
of the fertilising stream is then
requisite, the effects of which are
speedily evaporated. On this account
they are wholly inapplicable to grain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_771">771</span>
crops, and of very doubtful service to
potatoes or turnips. In the emphatic
language of farmers, they put no
<i>heart</i> into the ground. The vegetation
they force on is entirely in leaves
and stems, not in seeds or roots.
If they come into general use, they
may increase the determination of the
agricultural industry of the country to
grass cultivation, and render England
in modern, as Italy was in ancient
times, one great sheet of pasturage;
but they will never overcome the
difficulties with which free trade has
environed our farmers in the raising
of <i>grain</i> crops, or enable them to compete
with the harvests of the Ukraine,
or the basin of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>In the third place&mdash;and this is perhaps
a more vital consideration than
any&mdash;How is the constant recurrence of
monetary crises, similar to that which
has left such woful desolation behind
it, to be avoided upon every recurrence
of a deficient harvest at home,
or a straitened importation from
abroad? The people of England are
sensitively alive on this subject. They
watch the rain in autumn with the
most intense anxiety; and, if it falls
a few days more than usual, the utmost
alarm pervades all classes. They
know well what rain in autumn portends.
They see rising up, in dismal
perspective before them, a great importation
of grain, a vast export of
sovereigns, the screw put on by the
Bank of England, a contraction of
credits by every bank, every man
finding his creditors on his back, and
one-half of his debtors bankrupt. All
this they see, and see clearly; but the
minds of a large portion of them are so
benighted by the free-trade dogmas,
that it never occurs to them that all this
is the creation of their own policy, and
is in no degree imputable to the laws
of Providence. They think the thing
is inevitable. They believe that there
is a natural connexion between three
weeks' rain in August and a monetary
crisis, just as there is between a similar
deluge and flooded meadows, or
destroyed bridges. The evil, however,
is entirely of human creation,
and may, with absolute certainty, be
avoided by human means. There is
no more reason why three weeks' rain
in August should produce a monetary
crisis, than three weeks' rain in November.
It is our ruinous monetary laws
which render them cause and effect.</p>

<p>But assuming that the monetary
laws are to continue, and free trade to
be persisted in, it will become the
people of this country, and <i>especially
the trading classes</i>, to consider well
the inevitable effect of such a state of
things on the monetary concerns of the
country, and, through them, on the
solvency of every one of themselves.
We have seen that the heavy rains
and large importations of grain in
1839 produced the severe and long-protracted
period of distress from 1839
to 1842; and that the potato failure
in 1846, acting on the Bank Charter
Act of 1844, occasioned the terrible
catastrophe of October 1847. But
what was the importation of grain, in
either of these periods of distress or
famine, to that which is now taking
place, and has <i>become habitual in
the face of exceedingly low prices</i>?
In 1839, the whole grain of all kinds
imported was 4,000,000 quarters, an
amount in those days unprecedented.
In 1846 and 1847, 12,000,000 quarters,
under the stimulus of famine
prices, was imported in fifteen months.
But now, after a fine harvest, and
with wheat at 41s. a quarter, we are
importing annually, as our <i>average
amount, fifteen millions of quarters of
foreign grain</i>! How are the most
terrible commercial disasters to be
averted, if this immense amount receives
any augmentation from bad
seasons? Nay, how are they to be
averted even in ordinary seasons, with
so immense a drain on the metallic
resources of the country? This is
a question in which the mercantile
classes are far more interested than the
agricultural&mdash;for with them a monetary
crisis is an affair of life and death.
With landholders, cheap prices, unless
very long continued, are merely an
affair of temporary loss of income,
because the land itself remains, and
it is the value of the annual fruits
only that is affected.</p>

<p>To compensate so many perils, past,
present, and to come, have free trade
and a fettered currency, since they
were simultaneously brought into
action in this country, afforded such
a spectacle of internal prosperity and
concord as to render them on the whole
worth persisting in, at such hazard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_772">772</span>
to our national independence, and
even existence? Alas! the view is
now, if possible, more alarming than
the prospect of dangers to come, so
much have the realised and experienced
evils of the new system exceeded
what the most sombre imagination,
fraught with the most gloomy images,
could have anticipated. Amidst the
infinite variety of topics bearing on
this subject, we select the five following,
as bearing decisively on the
subject:&mdash;The increase of the poor-rate,
both in Great Britain and Ireland;
the increase in emigration; the
increase of crime; the decline in railway
travelling, and the ruin of agriculture
in Ireland.</p>

<p>With regard to the increase of the
poor-rate, since free trade and the
new monetary system were introduced,
we have the best possible
authority in the following statement
in the last number of a leading
journal. "It appears," says the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, "from Mr Commissioner
Symmon's report on pauperism, that
the poor-rate in England has now become
<i>heavier than it was before 1835</i>
when <i>the New Poor law was introduced</i>.
It was, in 1834, £7,373,807;
it was in 1848, £7,817,459. <i>Every
ninth person now in England is now
a pauper</i>: and the increase of paupers
during the last two years has been
double in proportion to the relative
numbers of criminals."<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> In Ireland,
above 2,000,000 persons are
paupers; and the poor-rate since
1846 has risen from £260,000 a-year
to £1,900,000, though it was in the
first of these years only (1846) that
there was any general failure of the
potato crop. In Scotland the poor-rate,
has nearly tripled in the last
three years; it has risen from £185,000
a-year to £560,000. In Glasgow, the
poor-rates, which anterior to 1846
were under £30,000 yearly for the
city and suburbs, rose in the year
1848-9 to £200,000, and in the
present year (1849-50) amount to
£138,500. Nor is it wonderful that
assessments have increased so prodigiously,
when the augmentation of
paupers has been so alarming. The
following is the increase in the city
of Glasgow parish, being about a
half of the city and suburbs, during
the last three years:&mdash;</p>

<p>The total number of paupers relieved
in the city of Glasgow and suburbs
in the year 1848-9 was 122,000;
being exactly <i>a third of the population</i>
receiving parochial relief.</p>

<p>The enormous and unprecedented
increase of emigration in the last three
years is still more alarming and descriptive
of the fatal disease under
which the body politic is labouring.
Previous to 1846 the annual emigration
had stood thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>But free trade and a fettered currency
soon doubled these numbers. The
emigration stands thus in round numbers:&mdash;</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>For 1849 the numbers have not yet
been made up; but that they have
much exceeded 300,000 is well known,
and may be judged of by the following
facts. From the official return
made up at New York, and published
in the <i>New York Herald</i> of October
10, it appears that, up to that date,
there had landed, in <i>that harbour alone</i>,
238,487 emigrants, of whom <i>no less
than 189,800 were Irish</i>. If to these
is added the emigrants who went to
Boston&mdash;where 13,000 landed in the
same period, and those who have gone
to Canada, where above 60,000 landed
last year&mdash;it is evident that the total
emigrants from the United Kingdom
this year must have considerably exceeded
300,000; being probably the
greatest emigration, from any country
in a single year, in the whole annals
of the world. It considerably exceeds
the annual increment of the population
of the United Kingdom, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_773">773</span>
about 230,000: so that, under the
combined action of free trade and a
fettered currency, <span class="smcap">the population of
Great Britain and Ireland, which
for three centuries had continually
been advancing, has for
the first time declined</span>. The Free-traders
may boast of an exploit which
all the enemies of England have never
been able to effect. This has become
so notorious, that it has passed into an
ordinary newspaper paragraph; which,
without attracting the least attention&mdash;though
it is the most striking thing
that has occurred in English history
for five centuries&mdash;is now making the
round of the public prints.</p>

<p>It is in vain to put this dismal fact
down to the account of the Irish famine.
That occurred in the winter of
1846-7, three years ago, since which
period we have had good harvests;
notwithstanding which the emigration
has, since that, been constantly
about 250,000; and this year, in the
midst of a fine harvest, has turned
300,000.</p>

<p>The <i>increase of crime</i> during the
last three years has been equally
alarming, and illustrative of the grievous
distress which, for that period, has
affected the industrial interests of the
empire. Having, in the last Number
of this magazine, fully discussed this
subject, we shall only observe that,
during the last three years, the increase
of crime in the two islands has
been nearly 50 <i>per cent.</i> Sir R. Peel,
in spring 1846, when the railway
mania was at its height, and full employment
was given to railway labourers
and mechanics in every part of the
country, dwelt with peculiar emphasis
and complacency on the diminution
of commitments which appeared in the
preceding year, as the most decisive
proof of the beneficial effect of his
measures in 1842. We hope he will
dwell with equal emphasis on the <i>increase</i>
of crime since that time, and
draw from it the appropriate conclusion
as to the wisdom of his subsequent
measures.</p>

<p>The woful state of the <i>railway</i>
interests throughout the country, and
the steady and alarming decrease of
the mileage profits, on an average of
all the lines, is another internal symptom
of the dreadful effects of the new
system which, within the last three
years, has been introduced. Railway
property, within the last three years,
has almost everywhere declined to a
half, in many great lines to a third of
its former value. In one of the greatest
lines in the kingdom, the £50 shares,
all paid up, are now selling at £14,
and were even lately down as low as
£10. The following is taken from the
<i>Times</i> of October 21:&mdash;</p>

<p>The decline in the last column, from 1845
to the present year, is sufficiently alarming,
and looks like a sinking to zero."</p></blockquote>

<p>To what is this lamentable sinking
of property, in so important a branch
of public investment, to be ascribed?
We are aware that much of it is owing
to unproductive branch lines; but
what is the main cause of these branch
lines having, contrary to general expectation,
proved so unproductive?
It is in vain to ascribe it to the
cholera: that only temporarily affected
parts of the kingdom; and, at
any rate, it is now over, and government
have very properly appointed a
public thanksgiving for its termination.
It is equally in vain to ascribe
it to the monetary crisis of 1847; that
is long since past: capital is overflowing,
and interest in London is again
down to 3 and 2-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> per cent. It is evidently
owing to one cause, worse than
plague, pestilence, and famine put
together&mdash;viz. the wasting away of
the internal resources of the country,
under the combined operation of free
trade and a restricted currency: free
trade deluging us with foreign goods
in every department of industry, and
a restricted currency paralysing every
attempt at competition in our own.
We are very complacent: we not
only present our shoulders bare to the
blows of the enemy, but we tie up our
own hands, lest, under the smart of the
injury, we should be tempted to return
them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_774">774</span></p>

<p>But by far the most deplorable
effect of free trade and a fettered currency
is to be seen in Ireland, where,
for the last three years, misery unexampled
and unutterable has existed.
We shall mention only three facts of a
general nature, descriptive of the state
of that unhappy country since the
simoom of the new principles blew over
it, and leave our readers to judge of
the state of things to which they point.</p>

<p>In the first place it appears, from a
parliamentary return, that the holders
of farms who, in 1845, were 310,000
over the Emerald Isle, had sunk in
1848 to 108,000. <i>Two hundred and
two thousand cultivators of land</i> have
disappeared in three years, and with
them at least half of the capital by
means of which the land was made to
produce anything.</p>

<p>In the second place, as we noticed
in our last Number, the bank returns
corroborate, in the most fearful
manner, this alarming decrease in the
agricultural capital and industry of the
country. Ireland, it is well known, is
almost entirely an agricultural country.
Now, from the returns of the bank-notes
in circulation in Ireland, as made
to government in terms of the act of
1845, it appears that, while in August
1846, <i>there were £7,500,000, they had
sunk, in August 1849, to £3,833,000</i>!
Othello's occupation is gone! The
bank-notes can find no employment:
the bankers no customers. Free trade
and the bank restrictions have in three
years reduced the circulation which
the country could take off to half of its
former amount.</p>

<p>In the third place, if we cast our
eyes across the Atlantic, we shall see
where the cultivators and agricultural
capital of Ireland have gone. During
the years 1847 and 1848, out of the
250,000 emigrants who annually left
the British Isles, about 180,000 were
from Ireland. But this year 1849,
when the duties on grain became
nominal in February, outdid all its
predecessors in the magnitude of the
stream of human beings which it
caused the Emerald Isle to send across
the Atlantic. It has been already
mentioned that, up to October 10,
1849, 189,800 Irish emigrants had
landed at New York, besides 10,000
at Boston. If to these we add the
probable number to Canada, perhaps
30,000, we shall have at least 230,000
Irish who have emigrated <i>in one year</i>
to America&mdash;and that a year of
general peace, a fine harvest, reopened
Continental markets, and revived
manufacturing industry in the empire.
And the Irish <i>county</i> members formed
a large part of Sir R. Peel's majority
which carried free trade in 1846.
Truly they have smote their constituents
hip and thigh.</p>

<p>After these facts, and the woful one,
that about 2,000,000 paupers are kept
alive in Ireland by a poor-rate of
£1,900,000 a-year, which is crushing
the little that remains of industry and
cultivation in the country, it is superfluous
to go into details. But the following
extracts from that powerful
free-trade journal, <i>The Times</i>, are so
graphic and characteristic of the effect
of its own favourite measures, that we
cannot forego the satisfaction of presenting
them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The landed gentry and farmholders in
this county, [Limerick,] impelled by a
national calamity, now at a crisis without
example in Ireland, have in contemplation
a meeting to represent to his Excellency
the Lord-Lieutenant the utterly
prostrate condition of all agricultural
property, and the universal failure
of every expedient in the best
rural economy to sustain the Irish
farmer&mdash;destitute of capital, bereft of
legitimate protection, and overwhelmed
by poor-rates and taxes&mdash;<i>against the
free-trade imports of the whole world</i>.
The ministerial policy of Great Britain,
under sanction of a law which thousands
of her loyal subjects deprecated, invites
<i>the foreign trader from all ports known to
the compass to import at a nominal duty,
and then suffers him to export in specie
only, for his own country</i>! What other
ballast have the fleets of foreign vessels
conveyed from our shore for the last three
years <i>but metallic and bank currency</i>?
With such immeasurably unequal competition
at his very door, the native
grower finds <i>no market for the produce of
his honest industry, unless at a price wholly
incompatible with the position of a solvent
man</i>. He sells, alas! only to lose, and
the selfish foreigner is sure of profit on
every cheap venture; while his speculation
renders no equivalent whatever to
the revenue or taxation of that state
which encourages his importations at the
expense of our own independence; for the
permanent independence of those kingdoms
implies the prosperity of Irish produce,
and its preference in the English
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_775">775</span>
market. Ireland, unfortunately, has no
trade or manufacture to employ her people,
and wherefore is best known to England;
but her only staple, agriculture,
which all nations, ancient and modern,
loved to cultivate, will soon be little more
than a name. The causes and effects of
this disastrous revolution the philosopher
and historian will hereafter do justice to.
A preparatory meeting, relative to the
above, is now being held, with closed
doors, in the county court, Lord Monteagle
in the chair. Poor-rate was the
monster grievance of discussion. The
meeting broke up at 3 o'clock, it having
been decided to collect facts from every
district of the country in connexion with
taxation and valuation of property."&mdash;<i>Limerick
Chronicle</i>, of Saturday, Oct. 26.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Land Question.</span>&mdash;A letter from
Kilrush, dated the 27th inst., and published
in the <i>Clare Journal</i>, says:&mdash;'So
eager are the country farmers to make
sale of their grain, that every day is a
market. Two causes seem to influence
them; first, their present and urgent
necessities press upon them, and, secondly,
an opinion prevails, which appears not to
be confined to the west, that it is more
secure to have the money in their pockets
than to leave the crop to become a prey
to agent or poor-rate collector; and also
that, in the event of no reduction being
made in the annual rent, they may have
no difficulty in walking off. Such are the
feelings operating on the minds of the
majority of the farmers in this locality.
It is now too plain and obvious, that
should a reduction in the rents take place
here, it will come two years too late, as
the greater number of the farmers (formerly
comfortable) have not as much as
would support their families for half the
coming year. This is a sad but true
state of things, in a district where, some
few years since, the rents were paid, perhaps,
more regularly than in any other
part of the south of Ireland. A few have
left their holdings, after selling every
article, leaving the naked walls of a house
to the landlord, and gone to a neighbouring
townland, where the quality and
cheapness of the land presented a greater
encouragement; but such cases of flying
tenants have become so common of late,
that every paper teems with similar statements.
<i>If we are to have the land cultivated
here, the rents must not only be reduced
to half the former price</i>, but the
tenant must be assisted to set the crop,
and encouraged to introduce a proper
method of cultivation, otherwise the land
will be left idle, and <i>the majority of the
present occupiers will become inmates of
the workhouse</i>.'"&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Oct. 31, 1849.</p>

<p>"There must also be taken into account
the dire domestic privations endured for
the last three years of famine, the general
flight of tenants with the landlords' rent,
the desertion of the land, impoverished to
the last degree by the runaways, yet for
whose dishonesty and abuse of solemn
contract the unfortunate proprietor is held
responsible&mdash;the abandoned farms being
still subject to accumulation of poor-rate
and taxes. Then come the distraint, the
impounding, the sale and sacrifice of property;
while the home market, <i>swamped
by free trade with foreigners</i>, has left landlord
and farmer no help or resource whatever
to bear up against the intolerable oppression
of financial burdens, sanctioned by
law, under the free constitution of Great
Britain! One case of grievous suffering
by a respectable family in this county was
communicated to the preparatory meeting
on Saturday last, by one of the gentlemen
present. The possessor of a rent-roll of
£1500 a-year landed estate, which netted
£1200 <i>annually four years ago, was absolutely
compelled to subsist with his wife and
seven children for three months of the past
twelve, without the ordinary comfort of a
meat dinner</i>; a cup of weak tea or coffee,
and the vegetables of the kitchen-garden,
commonly furnishing the table of this
most wretched household! Incredible
and appalling as this may appear, we
have been assured it is not a solitary instance
of the excessive want and privation
known to exist."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Nov. 4, 1849.</p></blockquote>

<p>So much for the working of free
trade and a restricted currency in the
Emerald Isle. One would suppose,
in reading these melancholy accounts,
we were not dealing with any people
in modern times, but transported back
to those dismal periods, after the fall
of the Roman empire, when the contemporary
annalists contemplated the
extinction of the human race, from the
desolation of some of its provinces.</p>

<p>This dreadful state of things in Ireland
is but a repetition of what, under
the operation of these causes, aided by the
fatal step of unqualified emancipation,
has for some years been going on
in the West Indies. We have not
room to enlarge on this prolific subject,
teeming as it does with facts illustrative
of the effects of the free-trade
system. They are generally known.
Suffice it to say, the <i>West Indies are
totally ruined</i>. British colonies, on
which £120,000,000 sterling has been
expended, and which fifteen years
ago produced £22,000,000 worth of
agricultural produce annually, have
been irrecoverably destroyed. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_776">776</span>
fee-simple of all the estates they contain
would not sell for £5,000,000
sterling. We know an estate in the
West Indies, which formerly used to
net £1500 a-year, and to which £7000
worth of the best new machinery
was sent within the last five years,
which the proprietor would be too happy
to sell, machinery and all, for £5000.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Canada</span> has lately shared largely
in the moral earthquake which has so
violently shaken all parts of the British
empire. We subjoin an extract
from the temperate and dignified
statement of their grievances, lately
published by 350 of the leading men
at Montreal, to show how largely
free trade enters into them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Belonging to all parties, origins, and
creeds, but yet agreed upon the advantage
of co-operation for the performance of a
common duty to ourselves and our country,
growing out of a common necessity, we
have consented, in view of a brighter and
happier future, to merge in oblivion all
past differences, of whatever character, or
attributable to whatever source. In appealing
to our fellow-colonists to unite
with us in this our most needful duty,
we solemnly conjure them, as they desire
a successful issue, and the welfare of their
country, to enter upon the task, at this momentous
crisis, in the same fraternal spirit.</p>

<p><i>The reversal of the ancient policy of
Great Britain, whereby she withdrew from
the colonies their wonted protection in her
markets, has produced the most disastrous
effects upon Canada.</i> In surveying the
actual condition of the country, what <i>but
ruin or rapid decay meets the eye</i>? Our
provincial government and civic corporations
embarrassed; our banking and
other securities greatly depreciated; our
mercantile and agricultural interests alike
unprosperous; real estate scarcely saleable
upon any terms; our unrivalled
rivers, lakes, and canals almost unused;
while commerce abandons our shores, <i>the
circulating capital amassed under a more
favourable system is dissipated</i>, with none
from any quarter to replace it! Thus,
without available capital, unable to effect
a loan with foreign states, or with the
mother country, although offering security
greatly superior to that which readily
obtains money both from the United States
and Great Britain, when other than colonists
are the applicants:&mdash;crippled,
therefore, and checked in the full career
of private and public enterprise, this
possession of the British crown&mdash;our
country&mdash;stands before the world in
humiliating contrast with its immediate
neighbours, exhibiting every symptom of
a nation fast sinking to decay.</p>

<p>With superabundant water-power
and cheap labour, especially in Lower
Canada, we have yet no domestic manufactures;
nor can the most sanguine, unless
under altered circumstances, anticipate
the home growth, or advent from
foreign parts, of either capital or enterprise
to embark in this great source of
national wealth. Our institutions, unhappily,
have not that impress of permanence
which can alone impart security and inspire
confidence, and the Canadian market is too
limited to tempt the foreign capitalist.</p>

<p>While the adjoining states are covered
with a network of thriving railways,
Canada possesses but three lines, which,
together, scarcely exceed fifty miles in
length, and the stock in two of which is
held at a depreciation of from 50 to 80
per cent&mdash;a fatal symptom of the torpor
overspreading the land."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Oct. 31.</p></blockquote>

<p>In what graphic terms are the inevitable
results of free trade and a restricted
currency here portrayed by
the sufferers under their effects!
Colonial protection withdrawn; home
industry swamped by foreign; canals
unused! banks alarmed; capital dissipated;
rivers and harbours untenanted;
property unsaleable! One
would have thought they were transcribing
from this magazine some of
the numerous passages in which we
have predicted its effects. And let
England recollect, Canada now employs
1,100,000 of the tonnage of
Great Britain. Let it be struck off,
and added to the other side, and the
British tonnage, employed in carrying
on our trade, will, in a few years, be
<i>made less than the foreign</i>.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_777">777</span></p>

<p>One would have thought, from the
present state of Canada, that our colonial
secretary had followed the advice
of Franklin in his "Rules for
making a <i>great Empire a small one</i>."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you are told of <i>discontents</i> in your
colonies, never believe that they are general,
or that you have given occasion for
them; therefore, <i>do not think of applying
any remedy or of changing any offensive
measure</i>. Redress no grievance, lest they
should be encouraged to demand the redress
of some other grievance. Yield no
redress that is just and reasonable, lest
they should make another demand that is
unreasonable. <i>Take all your informations
of the state of your colonies from your
governors</i> and officers in enmity with
them....</p>

<p>If you see <i>rival nations</i> rejoicing at
the prospect of your disunion with your
provinces, and endeavouring to promote
it&mdash;if they translate, publish, and applaud
all the complaints of your discontented
colonists, at the same time privately
stimulating you to severer measures&mdash;let
not that alarm or offend you. Why
should it? You all mean the same thing."&mdash;(<i>Rules
16 and 17.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>If our rulers had followed the advice
of the sages of former times, instead
of the theories of modern bullionists
and interested parties, they
would have avoided this unparalleled
accumulation of disasters. Hear the
greatest and wisest of men, Lord
Bacon, on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'For the home trade I first commend
to your consideration the encouragement of
tillage, which will enable the kingdom to
provide corn for the natives, and to spare
for importation; and I myself have known
more than once, when in times of dearth,
in Queen Elizabeth's days, it drained much
coin of the kingdom to furnish us with
corn from foreign parts.'</p>

<p>He added also&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let the foundation of a profitable
trade be so laid that the exportation of
home commodities be more in value than
the importation of foreign, so we shall be
sure that the stocks of the kingdom shall
yearly increase, for then the balance of
trade must be returned in money.'</p>

<p>And Lord Bacon went on to give this
wholesome piece of advice:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Instead of crying up all things which
are either brought from beyond sea or
wrought by the hands of strangers, let us
advance the native commodities of our
own kingdom, and employ our own
countrymen before strangers.'"&mdash;<i>Bacon's
Essays.</i></p>

<p>"Trade," says Locke, "is necessary to
the production of riches, <i>and money to the
carrying on of trade</i>. This is principally
to be looked after, and taken care of; for
if this be neglected, we shall in vain, by
contrivances among ourselves, and shuffling
the little money we have from one
hand to another, endeavour to prevent
our wants: decay of trade will quickly
waste all the remainder; and then the
landed man, who thinks, perhaps, by the
fall of interest, to raise the value of his
land, will find himself cruelly mistaken,
when, the money being gone, (as it will be
if our trade be not kept up,) he can get
neither farmer to rent, nor purchaser to
buy, his land."...</p>

<p>"If one-third of the money employed
in trade were locked up or gone out of
England, must not the landlords receive
one-third less for their goods, and, consequently,
rents fall&mdash;a less quantity of
money by one-third being to be distributed
amongst an equal number of receivers?
Indeed, people, not perceiving
the money to be gone, are apt to be jealous,
one of another; and each suspecting
another's inequality of gain to rob him of
his share, every one will be employing his
skill and power, the best he can, to retrieve
it again, and to bring money into
his pocket in the same plenty as formerly.
But this is but scrambling amongst ourselves,
and helps no more against our
wants than the pulling of a short coverlid
will, amongst children that lie together,
preserve them all from the cold&mdash;<i>some
will starve, unless the father of the family
provide better, and enlarge the scanty
covering</i>. This pulling and contest is
usually between the candid man and the
merchant."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Locke's</span> <i>Works</i>, v. 14, 70,
71. <i>Considerations on Rate of Interest
and Raising the Value of Money.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We add only the opinion of a great
authority with the Free-traders, Mr
Malthus, which seems almost prophetic
of what is now passing in this
country. We are indebted for it to
the <i>Morning Post</i>, which has consistently
argued the doctrines of protection
and an adequate currency since
they were first assailed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If the price of corn were to fall to 50s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_778">778</span>
a quarter, and labour and other commodities
nearly in proportion, there can be no
doubt that the stockholder would be benefited
unfairly at the expense of the industrious
classes of society. During the
twenty years, beginning with 1794, and
ending with 1813, the average price of
wheat was about 83s.; during ten years,
ending with 1813, 92s.; and during the
last five years of this same twenty, the
price was 108s. In the course of these
twenty years, government borrowed near
£500,000,000 of real capital, exclusive of
the sinking fund, at the rate of about five
per cent interest. But if corn shall fall
to 50s. a quarter, and other commodities
in proportion, instead of an interest of
five per cent., the government will really
pay an interest of seven, eight, and nine,
and for the last £200,000,000, of ten per
cent. This must be paid by the industrious
classes of society, and by the landlords;
that is, by all those whose nominal incomes
vary with the variations in the measure of
value; and if we completely <i>succeed in
the reduction of the price of corn and
labour</i>, this increased interest must be
paid in future from a revenue of about
<i>half the nominal value of the national
income in 1813</i>. If we consider with
what an increased weight the taxes on
tea, sugar, malt, soap, candles, &amp;c., would
in this case bear on the labouring classes
of society, and what proportion of their
income all the active, industrious middle
orders of the state, as well as the higher
orders, must pay, in assessed taxes and
the various articles of custom and excise,
<i>the pressure will appear to be absolutely
intolerable</i>. Indeed, if the measure of
value were really to fall as we have supposed,
there is great reason to fear that
the country would be <i>absolutely unable to
continue the payment of the present interest
of the national debt</i>."&mdash;<i>Malthus's Essays.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This was Mr Malthus's anticipation
of the effect of wheat falling to 50s.
What would he have said of it at 40s.,
its present average price? We recommend
the concluding paragraph to the
notice of the fund-holders, by whose
influence the late changes have mainly
been introduced.</p>

<p>But let the Free-traders be of good
cheer&mdash;they have done marvellous
things. They have accomplished what
no British statesmen, since the days
of Alfred, have been able to effect.
They have stopped the growth of our
population, and, for the first time for
four centuries, rendered it retrograde.
They have sent from two hundred
and fifty to three hundred thousand
people yearly out of the country, for
three years, in search of food. They
have lowered the Irish circulation
of notes a half. They have, with
one blow, swamped the Poor-law
Amendment Act in England, and rendered
rates higher, even with prices
extremely low, than they ever were
in English history. They have extirpated
200,000 cultivators in Ireland.
They have cut £80,000,000 a-year off
from the remuneration of cultivation
and the encouragement of the home
market to our manufactures in Great
Britain. They have lowered railway
property more than a half. They
have destroyed, at least, a half of the
whole commercial and trading wealth
of the manufacturing towns. They
have made the nation dependant, in
two years, for a fourth of its subsistence
on foreign states. They have
rendered the maintenance of the national
independence, if the present
system is persisted in, impossible.
They have destroyed £100,000,000
worth of property in the West Indies.
They have sown the seeds of revolt in
Canada, and rendered its separation,
at no distant period, from Great Britain
a matter of certainty. They
have repealed the Navigation Laws,
and thereby cut off the right arm of
our naval strength. They are fast
laying the seeds of dismemberment in
our colonial empire. They will soon
reduce, if unchecked in their career,
the immense empire of England to
two islands, oppressed with taxes,
eaten up by paupers, importing a third
of their annual subsistence from foreign
states, brought in in foreign bottoms.
These are the effects of <span class="smcap">FREE

At the first hint of a project of reform in the tariff, the cry in Spain, and especially
in Catalonia, has invariably been,&mdash;"Protection for our manufactures!" So loud
was the clamour, that it might have been imagined millions of mouths were dependent
for bread on the fabrication of Spanish calicoes. Now, the <i>Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> estimates the total number of hands employed in these much-vaunted cotton
manufactures at thirty-one thousand; and even this number we are induced to believe
considerably over-estimated, from minute and interesting information on the subject
we have recently obtained from an intelligent Spaniard, long resident in Catalonia.
And amongst the manufacturers are a number of Frenchmen, and other foreigners;
for, in fact, Spaniards have little taste for mechanical occupations, and have too fine
a climate not to love the open air. So the "protection," so violently insisted upon,
is for this handful of operatives, who make bad calicoes at exorbitant prices; or
rather, if the truth be told, it is for the master-manufacturers, most of whom are
also master-smugglers.</p></div>

<i>Campo Santo.</i>&mdash;It is probable that most of my readers will be acquainted with
the history of the Campo Santo at Pisa&mdash;composed of earth brought from Jerusalem
for a bed of sanctity, as the highest prize which the noble piety of crusaders could ask
or imagine. There is another Campo Santo at Naples, formed, however, (I presume,)
on the example given by Pisa. Possibly the idea may have been more extensively
copied. To readers who are unacquainted with England, or who (being English) are
yet unacquainted with the cathedral cities of England, it may be right to mention
that the graves within-side the cathedrals often form a flat pavement over which carriages
and horses might roll; and perhaps a boyish remembrance of one particular
cathedral, across which I had seen passengers walk and burdens carried, may have
assisted my dream.</p></div>

In reference to this state of things, the following important evidence was given
by the governor and deputy-governor of the Bank of England:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You had only £1,600,000 in the banking department for the payment of your
liabilities?&mdash;Yes.</p>

<p>If anybody had called upon you for anything beyond that million and a half, you
must have stopped payment?&mdash;Yes, we must.</p>

<p>At the same time, if there had been no separation between the two departments,
and the Bank of England had been conducted on its old principle, instead of being
within one million and a half of stopping, there would have been very nearly
£8,500,000 of treasure in your vaults?&mdash;We should have had £8,500,000 in our
vaults."&mdash;<i>Lords' Report</i>, 1848.</p></div>

The mortgages of England alone are estimated, by the best authorities, at
£400,000,000. Those of Ireland and Scotland are certainly at least half as much
more, or £200,000,000. Indeed, out of the rental of £14,000,000 a-year, now in
part become nominal in the former country, it is usually reckoned that £10,000,000
go to the holders of mortgages.</p></div>
